# Settings

This article covers handling your Uploadcare account, it explains how to create,
manage, and configure “Projects.”

To access an account, [sign up for Uploadcare][account-signup] and navigate to
your [dashboard][dashboard].

<!-- TODO: apply regex for all the files -->
<!-- (<H2 )anchor="(.*)">(.*)(</H2>) -->
<!-- ## $3\n{id="$2"} -->

<!-- Roma: WTF is that ^ -->

## Projects
{id="projects"}

The Uploadcare experience is centered around the concept of a project.
Projects are separate environments that can hold different sets of files and
settings. For instance, you could use one project to receive user-generated
content, another for implementing advanced security features, and a third one
to serve your frontend assets.

When you sign up for a new Uploadcare account, we add one default project. So,
explicitly adding another project is optional: you can stick with the default
one for creating a test environment and going through every other section of
this article.

## Project API Keys
{id="keys"}

Uploadcare APIs and API clients (e.g., [File Uploader][file-uploader-configure])
tell your projects from one another by their API keys.

We provide the two kinds of API keys: [public](#keys-public) and
[secret](#keys-secret). In this documentation, we refer to those as `public_key`
and `secret_key`, respectively.

To discover API keys for an Uploadcare project, navigate to the
respective section on the project overview page in
your [dashboard][dashboard].

Depending on which Uploadcare features you want to use, you will implement
either your `public_key` or a key pair.

### Public API Key
{id="keys-public"}

The main use of a `public_key` is to identify a target project for your uploads.
It is required when using [Upload API][api-reference-upload] or its clients such
as the [File Uploader][file-uploader].

### Secret API Keys
{id="keys-secret"}

A `secret_key` is required when using our [REST API][api-reference-rest] to
manage files within a project or implement [Video Processing][transformations-video],
[Document Conversion][transformations-docs] or [Object Recognition][intelligence-object-recognition],
or when using [Secure Uploading][api-reference-signed-uploads]. You can add
multiple secret API keys to a single Uploadcare project to ensure extended
control options over your environments.

## Project Files
{id="project-settings-files"}

The Files section allows viewing the set of files associated with the project.
You can add new files, search the set for entries, copy individual file URLs or
UUIDs, and delete files from a project.

<Image uuid="84ccc304-9fde-467d-aa09-a7a36a514886" desc="Project settings, Files" />

While the Files view allows you to implement basic files management, use our
[REST API][api-reference-rest] for more sophisticated scenarios like integrating
Uploadcare with your product’s API.

## Project Advanced Settings
{id="project-settings-advanced"}

Under the Settings section, you can find more sophisticated options. Change
those when setting up specific file flows; the deafults are perfectly fine for
the majority of appliances.

### Automatic File Storing
{id="project-settings-advanced-autostore"}

<!-- TODO: Rewrite here -->
When you Store files on Uploadcare, you make them permanent as opposed to
temporary ones that are deleted from your account in 24 hours after the upload.
By default, Uploadcare automatically stores every uploaded file. You can change
the behavior by disallowing “Automatic file storing.”

<Image uuid="03206e16-951c-4d83-a225-8577e0528eeb" desc="Project settings, Uploads, Automatic File Storing" />

Then, every file will be treated as temporary unless you explicitly Store a file
by making a request to our [REST API][api-reference-rest-store].

### Secure Uploading
{id="project-settings-signed-uploads"}

You can further enhance the security of your file uploading by generating a
special token on your backend and requiring our API to check token validity.
This will allow you to implement access and control management in file uploading
flows. This sections allows you to turn on the behavior. Note, when switched on,
we will no longer accept any uploads to the project without a token. Please,
refer to our [Documentation][api-reference-signed-uploads] to learn more.

<Image uuid="592fe21d-e181-475f-b5f2-4c430e24221b" desc="Project settings, Uploads, Secure Uploads" />

### Webhooks
{id="project-settings-advanced-webhooks"}

Uploadcare REST API allows adding custom webhooks to notify your application
about file uploads with the customized payload. Please, refer to our
[Documentation][api-reference-rest-webhooks] to learn more.

<Image uuid="b4f422c7-9e15-4675-9246-0df3791bb9fc" desc="Project settings, Uploads, Webhooks" />

### Custom Amazon S3 Bucket Storage
{id="project-settings-custom-storage"}

You may choose to connect your storage to Uploadcare instead of using the one
provided by Uploadcare (storage limits depend on your [Pricing Plan][pricing]).
Note that Uploadcare CDN features won't be available. Please, refer to the
respective section of our [Documentation][storage-custom] for details.

<Image uuid="54e61523-0f45-4ed5-a67b-97d190210e8e" desc="Project settings, Uploads, Custom Storage" />

### Configure Backups
{id="project-settings-advanced-backup"}

<!-- TODO: add Stored link to Glossary -->

You can have all your Stored files to be copied to a custom S3 Bucket (or
Selected Storage) automatically. Connect the storage once, and the system will do
backups on a timely basis.

<Image uuid="ec5aeca0-90cd-4af3-8072-91d93c7311ee" desc="Project settings, Uploads, Backup" />

### Custom OAuth Applications
{id="project-settings-advanced-oauth"}

With File Uploader, users can upload files from various upload sources, such as
Google Drive and Facebook. By default, _Uploadcare_ requests access to these
cloud services. This allows Uploadcare to see and download all files stored with
this service.

    type='video/mp4'
  />

With custom OAuth, you can set up _your application_ icon, name, as well as
Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

<Image uuid="3b688eb0-d1ab-46b9-90ba-81c45c0d80b2" desc="Project settings, Uploads, Custom OAuth applications" />

Check out [OAuth connection examples][community-oauth].

### Whitelist
{id="project-settings-advanced-whitelist"}

Protect your account from bad actors willing to do optimisations on your behalf,
and get a proxy endpoint for Adaptive Delivery.

<Image uuid="25add8ba-c28c-4d0f-a9d3-707fe3fdd86a" desc="Project settings, Delivery, Adaptive Delivery" />

### Edit Project
{id="project-settings-advanced-project"}

This section allows changing the name of your project or removing it from your
account. Click three dots next to the project's name in the list of projects to
see the editing options.

<Image uuid="52cd9173-08da-4d3d-8e94-60dfffcc7654" desc="Project list, Edit project" />

## Billing Options
{id="billing"}

You can go to your Uploadcare Billing Options from your Dashboard or by using
[this link][account-billing]. From there, you can:

* See your [current plan][account-billing], limits status, and details about the
  charges for the next billing period.
* Configure your [payment options][account-card]: manage added cards and see
  payments history.
* Configure [profile information][account-settings].
