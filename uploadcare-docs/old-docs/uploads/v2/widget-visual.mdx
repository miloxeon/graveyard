## Color Buttons
{id="color-buttons"}

One of the things you can do is change upload button color.
This can be easily done using CSS.

<!-- https://codepen.io/uploadcare/pen/QRvwYQ -->
<CodePen defaultTab="html" id="QRvwYQ" title="Color buttons example" />

## Uploading Circle Color
{id="uploading-circle-color"}

Uploading circle fill color can be changed via CSS `color` property
and backgroud color can be changed via `border-color` property.

<CodePen defaultTab="html,result" id="vwmEMK" title="Uploading circle color example #1" />

<CodePen defaultTab="result" id="Ezmazz" title="Uploading circle color example #2" />

## Custom Progress Bar
{id="custom-progress-bar"}

If you want to replace builtin progress bar, you need to listen current widget
object. You can obtain it in `onChange` callback. It will be file object
for regular widget and group object for multiple widget. Then you need
to listen to `progress` event and change your progress bar in accordance with
current `uploadProgress`.

This is done in following `installProgressBar` function. It receives
two arguments: Uploadcare widget instance and your progress bar DOM element.
Anything else, including animation, is done via CSS.

## Uploaded Image Preview
{id="uploaded-image-preview"}

When user selects some image, it will be shown in the upload dialog.
But what to do if you want to show image preview right on the page
near to uploading widget.
Such preview is more informative for user than file name and size.

<!-- https://codepen.io/uploadcare/pen/EzmjYB -->
<CodePen id="EzmjYB" title="Uploaded image preview example #1" />

You have full control of size and position, it can be changed via CSS.

Image preview for multiupload widget may look different:

<!-- https://codepen.io/uploadcare/pen/PvmqwK -->
<CodePen id="PvmqwK" title="Uploaded image preview example #2" />

You can choose different images or just rearrange existing ones:
all changes in widget will be reflected in the thumbnail list.
