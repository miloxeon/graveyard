## Upload API

Build custom uploading flow using Upload API directly or with an API client.

<DocsTabs defaultTab='curl'>
  <DocsTabsContainer>
    <DocsTab to='curl'>cUrl</DocsTab>
    <DocsTab to='js'>JavaScript</DocsTab>
    <DocsTab to='python'>Python</DocsTab>
  </DocsTabsContainer>
  <DocsPanelsContainer>
    <DocsTabPanel tab='curl'>
      <CurlUrlUpload />
    </DocsTabPanel>
    <DocsTabPanel tab='js'>
      <JsUrlUpload />
    </DocsTabPanel>
    <DocsTabPanel tab='python'>
      <PythonUrlUpload />
    </DocsTabPanel>
  </DocsPanelsContainer>
</DocsTabs>

Once a file is uploaded, it's available by a URL with the UUID:

```cdn
https://ucarecdn.com/017162da-e83b-46fc-89fc-3a7740db0a82/
```

## File Uploader

We’ve built a UI that uses Upload API so you don’t have to. Integrate it in the
page's `<head>`:

```html
<script
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/3.x/uploadcare.full.min.js">
</script>
```

And use File Uploader in the page's `<body>`:

```html
<input
  type="hidden"
  role="uploadcare-uploader"
  data-public-key="demopublickey"
  name="my_file" />
```

The regular `<input>` element will appear like this (clickable):

<Widget clearable />

This responsive widget works in all modern browsers, on all devices and it has a
plenty of features and customization options.

## Alternative methods

Transfer and deliver your existing files with Uploadcare without explicitly
uploading:

- [Proxy][delivery-proxy] — delivers files from your domain via [Uploadcare CDN][delivery-cdn].
- [Migration tool][migro-guide] transfers your files from other platforms.

## Secure uploading

Control who can upload files to your account by authenticating upload
requests.<div style="padding-bottom: 1vw;" />
