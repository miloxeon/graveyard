# Uploadcare Proxy

Uploadcare delivers your files with [a powerful CDN][delivery-cdn]. It implies
that you need to upload files to Uploadcare storage first. If you want to use
our CDN without _explicitly_ uploading files to Uploadcare, this is the feature
you want to use. Proxy allows you to integrate Uploadcare into your solution
with only minor URL modifications:

```
https://yoursite.ucr.io/ + https://yoursite.com/assets/image.jpg =
https://yoursite.ucr.io/https://yoursite.com/assets/image.jpg
```

Proxy will upload files to your Uploadcare storage as soon as they’re
requested. It will also allow you to use Uploadcare CDN features.

Primarily, Proxy is used to deliver images along with [image
transformations][transformations-image]. You can deliver other files as well.
Your original file URLs will still work.

Note: Try out [Adaptive Delivery][delivery-adaptive] which adapts images to any
device automatically with a simple setup. Use Proxy for a more manual approach.

## Setting Up
{id="setup"}

Open your Uploadcare project's Dashboard and select **Delivery** from the main
menu on the left. Click **Connect** for **Proxy.**

<!-- Add screenshot from Dashboard here -->

### Step 1. Provide a List of Allowed Domains
{id="setup-domains"}

Specify the domain names that host your files. The Proxy will recognize these
domains and deliver files successfully. You can add one or more domains in the
**Proxy** dialog window.

### Step 2. Custom Proxy Endpoint (optional)
{id="setup-endpoint"}

By default, Uploadcare creates a proxy endpoint for every project automatically:
`PUBLIC_KEY.ucr.io` (e.g., `88a247b663ba80c3bf6f.ucr.io`).

As you can see, a default subdomain for the endpoint is your project's Public
key. All links start with this URL, so you can change it to something readable.
Custom endpoint examples:
* CNAME or subdomain endpoint will look like: `mydomain.ucr.io`
* A record or domain endopoint will look like: `cdn.mydomain.com`

## Using Proxy
{id="usage"}

Here's how to use Proxy after it's set up.

### Step 1. Add Proxy prefix
{id="usage-prefixes"}

Add the Proxy prefix that contains your Endpoint to a file URL on the allowed
domain:

```
https://yoursite.ucr.io/ + https://yoursite.com/assets/image.jpg =
https://yoursite.ucr.io/https://yoursite.com/assets/image.jpg
```

After that, `image.jpg` will be delivered via [Uploadcare CDN][delivery-cdn].
The original file will remain at its original place, so that older references
will work as well.

Now you can add prefixes to all images using your IDE or text editing tool.
Apply CDN operations when needed.

<!-- Misha: SUGG: Maybe create regular expressions for changing all pictures in
entire code? Or a python script that'll do this substitution. -->

### Step 2. Apply image transformations
{id="usage-transformations"}

You can apply [image transformations][transformations-image] by adding one of
the respective [URL directives][transformations-image] **between** the prefix
and media URL.

[This CDN operation][transformations-image-resize] will resize `image.jpg` to
500 px in width by adding `cdn›-/preview/-/resize/500x/`:

```
https://yoursite.ucr.io/-/preview/-/resize/500x/https://yoursite.com/assets/image.jpg
```

As a result, `image.jpg` will be resized and delivered with Uploadcare CDN.

You can also optimize your responsive image handling workflow and free up some
storage space by deleting image versions in different sizes for adaptive
layouts. Uploadcare resizes images on the fly and you don't have to save all
versions beforehand. Here's how to generate multires images:

```
1260 pixels in width:
https://yoursite.ucr.io/-/preview/-/resize/1260x/https://yoursite.com/assets/image.jpg

760 pixels in width:
https://yoursite.ucr.io/-/preview/-/resize/760x/https://yoursite.com/assets/image.jpg

512 pixels in width:
https://yoursite.ucr.io/-/preview/-/resize/512x/https://yoursite.com/assets/image.jpg
```

### Possible Errors
{id="errors"}

Here's a list of errors you might get when using Proxy:

#### \[HTTP 400\] `Domain <yoursite.com> is not registered`

You did not register a Proxy domain for your sites by dropping us a line at
[help@uploadcare.com][mail-help].

#### \[HTTP 400\] `Domain <yoursite.com> is not allowed`

You tried fetching a file from a domain that was not allowed. Check settings or
contact us to add the domain as allowed for your account.

#### \[HTTP 400\] `Failed to parse file URL`

Your prefix was added to an invalid URL. Consider checking that URL.

#### \[HTTP 404\]

You tried fetching an unreachable file. Consider checking its URL.

#### \[HTTP 502\] `'is_ready' timeout`

A problem occurred when trying to upload a file to our storage. Try again later
and if it didn't help you always can [contact us][mail-help].

#### Other errors

Proxy uses the `from_url` method, so you can also get general
[errors][api-reference-upload-errors] related to the Upload API or specific to
the `from_url` [method][api-reference-upload-fromurl-errors].

## Proxy Use Cases
{id="cases"}
<!-- Roma: Looks like this is a place for a guide. -->

We picked a collection of the most popular Proxy use cases. These cases are
about optimizing traffic, improving load time, and handling your assets the way
you need.

* [Implement Responsive Images](#cases-ri)
* [Improve Load Time](#cases-load-time)
* [Cut Traffic Costs](#cases-traffic)
* [Migrate to the Cloud](#cases-migrate)

### Implement Responsive Images
{id="cases-ri"}

After you set up delivery with Proxy, there's just one step to build a
responsive design. Responsive images require that you prepare images in
different sizes and later list them in the `srcset` attribute or the `<picture>`
element.

Check out our blog [article][blog-responsive-images] on Image Transformations
that covers responsive techniques.

### Improve Load Time
{id="cases-load-time"}

Uploadcare Proxy fetches your assets and delivers them via [Uploadcare
CDN][delivery-cdn]. That alone improves load time of your assets because they
get served from a CDN node best for your client’s location.

When handling media, Proxy provides further load time improvement by letting you
cut file sizes at no visual quality loss. With images, that can be done via our
[Image Transformations][transformations-image] feature.

Specifically, take a look at the following on-the-fly operations:

* [`format`][transformations-image-format], convert images to WebP, PNG or JPEG.
  It's recommended to use `format/auto`
* [`quality`][transformations-image-quality], adjust image quality.
* [`resize`][transformations-image-resize], adjust image size.

This set of tools can help accelerate your images [up to
9x][blog-accelerate-images].

You can compare page load time and traffic optimization with Uploadcare CDN and
without. Use tools like [Chrome DevTools][ext-devtools-network] for local tests.
Play around with the image [quality][transformations-image-compression] and find
a sweet spot for the best visual traffic compression results.

<!-- Misha: TODO you can use Smart Compression -->

Note that the first request for each media file over Proxy URL will copy it to
Uploadcare CDN. Therefore, there won't be a performance improvement yet.
However, once it gets copied to our servers, all subsequent requests will fetch
the file from the closest CDN node.

### Cut Traffic Costs
{id="cases-traffic"}

While accelerating your media [improves your conversions][ext-kiss-load-time],
using less bandwidth cuts your traffic costs.

The workflow here is quite the same as in the [load time](#cases-load-time)
section: you control [media formats][transformations-image-format],
[quality][transformations-image-quality] levels, and
[dimensions][transformations-image-resize]. It helps you get smaller files
without any visual quality loss.

### Migrate to the Cloud
{id="cases-migrate"}

A possible case is that you already use a File API or cloud storage for your
assets. In both cases, it is easy to migrate. [Set up Proxy](#setup), make a
list of your asset URLs, and [replace them](#usage-prefixes).

Your existing media assets may be transformed on-the-fly with the File API. Read
more on [Image Transformations][transformations-image] here in docs. Learn [how
to use them](#usage-transformations) with Proxy.

### Seamlessly Integrate Uploadcare
{id="cases-integrate"}

The simplest way to integrate file APIs is doing it from scratch, i.e., when
developing a new product or scaling an existing one. That’s not always the case.
When you have already got a bunch of assets, use Proxy to fetch those to
Uploadcare and optimize their delivery on autopilot. This can be done in four
simple steps:

* [Set up](#setup) the Proxy.
* Iterate through all of your assets and parse their URLs.
* Fetch those assets via [Proxy](#usage) to your Uploadcare project.
* Change your asset URLs to their optimized versions: [add
  prefixes](#usage-prefixes).

### Assess Your Performance
{id="cases-performance"}

Before signing up or migrating, you want to measure how Uploadcare can improve
your system’s performance. Our advice, in this case, is using Uploadcare only
for certain areas of your web or mobile app and then comparing how they perform
before and after integrating with Uploadcare:

* Pick an area of your web or mobile app that you monitor: understand
  conversions and average load time.
* [Set up Proxy](#setup) to work with your Uploadcare account.
* Iterate through your assets related to that preferred area and replace URLs
  with their optimized versions: [add prefixes](#usage-prefixes).
* [Apply transformations](#usage-transformations) to further optimize your media
  assets where applicable.
* Run tests, collect statistics, and compare how the tested part of your web or
  mobile app performs after implementing optimizations.
