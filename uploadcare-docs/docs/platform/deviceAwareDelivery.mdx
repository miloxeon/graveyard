Device-aware delivery is an Uploadcare's full-stack image optimization solution. It adapts images to
user context: screen size, browser, location, and other parameters. The optimization includes lazy
loading, smart compression, WebP, responsive images, and retina display support. Altogether, it
speeds up page loading and improves user experience without any coding.

The main advantage is that you donâ€™t need to use `srcset`, media queries, image resizing and other
operations. Uploadcare will handle all that automatically.

## Usage

Connect the Device-aware Delivery JS library:

```jsx
<script>
	(function (src, cb) {
		var s = document.createElement('script')
		s.setAttribute('src', src)
		s.onload = cb
		(document.head || document.body).appendChild(s)
	})('https://ucarecdn.com/libs/blinkloader/3.x/blinkloader.min.js', function () {
		window.Blinkloader.optimize({
			pubkey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
			fadeIn: true,
			lazyload: true,
			smartCompression: true,
			responsive: true,
			retina: true,
			webp: true,
		})
	})
</script>
```

Now you can do this:

```html
<img data-blink-src="https://example.com/foo.png" alt="" />
<div data-blink-src="https://example.com/foo.png">You can set background-image</div>
```

Image will be uploaded to Uploadcare and served via our CDN. It will be automatically optimized for
the end device.

You can also serve already uploaded images with UUIDs:

```html
<img data-blink-uuid="6493f2d1-a476-427f-bcd5-94330cc02837" alt="" />
<div data-blink-uuid="6493f2d1-a476-427f-bcd5-94330cc02837">You can set background-image</div>
```

Setting `data-blink-src` or `data-blink-uuid` attributes onto a `div` will set its
`background-image` property.

## Configuration

You can configure Device-aware Delivery by passing a configuration object to the
`BlinkLoader.optimize()` method. Here are the supported properties:

<Options />

## Applying transformations

You can specify transformations with either of these methods:

```html
<img
	data-blink-ops="filter: nerion; enhance: 15; mirror"
	data-blink-src="https://example.com/foo.png"
	alt=""
/>
```

```html
<img
	data-blink-filter="nerion"
	data-blink-enhance="15"
	data-blink-mirror
	data-blink-src="https://storage.example.com/logo.png"
	alt=""
/>
```

Note, Device-aware Delivery adds `resize`, `format` and `quality` automatically. We don't recommend
changing the behavior, since we calculate the transformation parameters based on the user device.

Otherwise, the available transformations and their limits are the same as in URL-based approach.

## Extra-large images

The output [image size limit](https://uploadcare.com/docs/transformations/image/#dimensions)
delivered with CDN is 3000 px in either dimension. JPEG images can be resized up to 5000 px. For
that, you need to set the image format explicitly.

Adaptive Delivery will resize an image up to 5000 px automatically, when:

1. `data-blink-src` has a file extension `jpeg` or `jpg` (case-insensitive). For example,
   `https://yourdomain.com/image.jpg`
2. `data-blink-format` is `auto` or `jpeg`. When you set `webp:true` (default), `auto` is set
   implicitly.
