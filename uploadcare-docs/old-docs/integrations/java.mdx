# Java API Client 

Java integration handles uploads and file operations by wrapping Uploadcare
[Upload API][api-reference-upload] and [REST API][api-reference-rest]. This
comprehensive API client lets you use most of the Uploadcare features from within
your Java app.

[GitHub &rarr;][java-github]

## Features

Upload features:
* Upload files from local storage and URLs (up to 5 TB)
* Multipart uploading for large files
* Uploading network to speed uploading jobs (like CDN)

File management features:
* Get file info and perform various operations (store/delete/copy) with them
* Work with groups of files 
* Get info about account project
* Manage webhooks
* Paginated resources are fetched as `List<T>`
* CDN path builder

Security features:
* Secure authentication
* Secure uploads (signed uploads)

## Requirements
{id="sign-up"}

* [Uploadcare account][account-signup]
* [Java JDK][ext-java-jdk-downloads]

Go to your Uploadcare [Dashboard][dashboard] and create a new project for your
Java app. It'll have [API keys][settings-keys] to complete Java API client
integration.

## Setup
{id="setup"}

The latest stable library version is available at [Maven Central][ext-maven-java-version-list].

Include the following code into your build by adding the following dependencies
into `pom.xml` for your project.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.uploadcare</groupId>
  <artifactId>uploadcare</artifactId>
  <version>3.3.1</version>
</dependency>
```

To build with Gradle add to Gradle build file:

```groovy
compile 'com.uploadcare:uploadcare:3.3.1'
```

## Usage example

### Create `Client` and basic API usage
{id="client-init"}

Use your [Public][settings-keys-public] and [Secret][settings-keys-secret] API
Keys from the Java project's dashboard.

Create a new API Client:

```java
Client client = new Client("publicKey", "secretKey");
Project project = client.getProject();
Project.Collaborator owner = project.getOwner();

List<URI> published = new ArrayList<URI>();
Iterable<File> files = client.getFiles().asIterable();
for (File file : files) {
    if (file.isMadePublic()) {
        published.add(file.getOriginalFileUrl());
    }
}
```
### Building CDN URLs
{id="building-cdn-urls"}

Uploadcare CDN can apply image transformations by adding directives like this:

```cdn
https://ucarecdn.com/85b5644f-e692-4855-9db0-8c5a83096e25/-/resize/640x640/image.jpg
```

Here's a Java example to automate CDN URL creation:

```java
File file = client.getFile("85b5644f-e692-4855-9db0-8c5a83096e25");
CdnPathBuilder builder = file.cdnPath()
        .resizeWidth(200)
        .cropCenter(200, 200)
        .grayscale();
URI url = Urls.cdn(builder);
```

### Upload files with `FileUploader` and `UrlUploader`
{id="uploader"}

Check out two options to upload files with the Java Uploadcare library
`Uploader` interface.

Upload with [UrlUploader][java-github-urluploader]:

```java
@Test
void uploadFileWithUrlUploader_uploadedAndRequestedFilesShouldMatch() throws UploadFailureException {
  Uploader uploader = new UrlUploader(client, URL);
  File uploadedFile = uploader.upload();
  String uploadedFileId = uploadedFile.getFileId();

  File requestedByIdFile = client.getFile(uploadedFileId);

  then(requestedByIdFile.hasOriginalFileUrl()).isTrue();
  then(requestedByIdFile.getOriginalFileUrl().getRawPath()).contains(uploadedFileId);
  then(requestedByIdFile.getOriginalFilename()).isEqualToIgnoringCase(SHUTTERSTOCK_FILE_NAME);
  then(requestedByIdFile.getMimeType()).isEqualTo("image/jpeg");
  then(requestedByIdFile.isRemoved()).isFalse();
  then(requestedByIdFile.isStored()).isTrue();
  then(requestedByIdFile.getUploadDate()).isInSameHourAs(new Date());
}
```

Upload with [FileUploader][java-github-fileuploader] by providing `java.io.File`:

```java
@Test
void uploadFileWithFileUploader_uploadedAndRequestedFilesShouldMatch() throws UploadFailureException {
  java.io.File localFile = new java.io.File(Optional.ofNullable(getClass().getClassLoader()
      .getResource(LOCAL_FILE_NAME)).map(java.net.URL::getFile)
      .orElseThrow(RuntimeException::new));
  Uploader uploader = new FileUploader(client, localFile);
  File uploadedFile = uploader.upload();
  String uploadedFileId = uploadedFile.getFileId();

  File requestedByIdFile = client.getFile(uploadedFileId);

  then(requestedByIdFile.hasOriginalFileUrl()).isTrue();
  then(requestedByIdFile.getOriginalFileUrl().getRawPath()).contains(uploadedFileId);
  then(requestedByIdFile.getOriginalFilename()).isEqualToIgnoringCase(LOCAL_FILE_NAME);
  then(requestedByIdFile.isRemoved()).isFalse();
  then(requestedByIdFile.isStored()).isTrue();
  then(requestedByIdFile.getUploadDate()).isInSameHourAs(new Date());
}
```

Note: the `com.uploadcare.api.File#getOriginalFileUrl` method returns a
combination of UUID and an original file name without whitespaces.

### Manage project data and files
{id="project-and-files"}

With `Client`, you get a few utility methods to retrieve and handle the
project-specific data, like fetching a file by a file id or listing all uploaded
files for the project. Note, _ids_ are Uploadcare [UUIDs][uploads]
associated with files whenever they get uploaded.

Here’s a short example of navigating your files and retrieving 10 file names
uploaded to your project after today’s midnight and matching some arbitrary
pattern:

```java
// Print 10 file names uploaded after today's midnight and matching regexp
client.getFiles().asList()
        .stream()
        .map(f -> new Pair<>(f.getOriginalFilename(), f.getUploadDate()))
        .filter(p -> p.getValue().after(Date.from(todayMidnight))
                && p.getKey().matches(FILENAME_STARTING_WITH_LETTERS_AND_HAVING_EXTENSION))
        .limit(10)
        .forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Automatic File Storing
{id="auto-storing-mode"}

When **Automatic File Storing.** in [project settings][settings-advanced-autostore]
is on (default), all newly uploaded files will be stored permanently. If it's
switched off, all incoming files will be deleted in 24 hours to prevent your
storage cluttering.

With **Automatic File Storing.** turned off, you can still `store` files
selectively via API. In Java, these per-file controls are provided by both
`com.uploadcare.api.Client#saveFile` taking a UUID as a parameter and
`com.uploadcare.api.File#save`.

### Transfer files to Amazon S3
{id="custom-storage"}

You can connect an Amazon S3 Bucket to your Uploadcare account as a custom
storage for specific [cases][storage-custom]. See [docs][storage-custom-setup]
on how to configure it.

With the Java library, you can move files to custom storage with the
`com.uploadcare.api.Client#copyFile` [method][java-github-copyFile]. You can do
the same via [REST API][api-reference-rest-copy].
