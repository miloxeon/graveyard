# Swift API Client and File Uploader

Swift integration handles uploads and file operations by wrapping Uploadcare
[Upload API][api-reference-upload] and [REST API][api-reference-rest]. This
comprehensive API client lets you use most of the Uploadcare features from within
your Android app. It also includes a native File Uploader widget. Builds are
available for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, macOS, and Linux.

[GitHub &rarr;][swift-github]

Check out a [demo app](swift-github-demo) that we created as a showcase for
various usage scenarios and tasks that you can resolve.

## Features

* Upload files from a file, URL, and cloud sources (up to 5 TB)
* Multipart uploading for large files
* Track, pause and continue multipart uploading

* Uploading network to speed uploading jobs (like CDN)

File management features:
* Get file info and perform various operations (store/delete/copy) with them
* Work with groups of files 
* Get info about account project
* Manage webhooks
* Convert documents
* Encode and transform videos

Security features:
* Secure authentication
* Secure uploads (signed uploads)
* Secure delivery (authenticated URLs)

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To use a stable version, add a dependency to your Package.swift file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-swift.git", .branch("master"))
]
```

If you want to try the current dev version, change dependency to:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-swift.git", branch("develop"))
]
```

To add from Xcode select File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency and
enter repository URL:

```
https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-swift
```

Or you can add it in Xcode: https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-swift
(select master branch).

### Carthage

To use a stable version, add a dependency to your Cartfile:

```
github "uploadcare/uploadcare-swift"
```

To use the current dev version:

```
github "uploadcare/uploadcare-swift" "develop"
```

### Cocoapods

To use a stable version, add a dependency to your Podfile:

```
pod 'Uploadcare', git: 'https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-swift'
```

To use current dev version:

```
pod 'Uploadcare', git: 'https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-swift', :branch => 'develop'
```

## Initialization

Create your project in [Uploadcare dashboard][dashboard] and copy its API keys
from there.

Upload API requires only a public key, while REST API requires both public and
secret keys:

```swift
let uploadcare = Uploadcare(withPublicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY")
// Secret key is optional. Initialization with secret key:
let uploadcare = Uploadcare(withPublicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY", secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY")
```

## Using Upload API

Check the [Upload API documentation][swift-github-docs-upload] to see all available
methods.

Example of direct uploads:

```swift
guard let url = URL(string: "https://source.unsplash.com/random") else { return }
guard let data = try? Data(contentsOf: url) else { return }

// You can create UploadedFile object to operate with it
let fileForUploading1 = uploadcare.uploadAPI.file(fromData: data)
let fileForUploading2 = uploadcare.uploadAPI.file(withContentsOf: url)

// Handle error or result
fileForUploading1.upload(withName: "random_file_name.jpg", store: .store) { (result, error) in
}

// Completion block is optional
fileForUploading2?.upload(withName: "my_file.jpg", store: .store)

// Or you can just upload data and provide a filename
let task = uploadcare.uploadAPI.upload(files: ["random_file_name.jpg": data], store: .store, expire: nil, { (progress) in
    print("upload progress: \(progress * 100)%")
}) { (resultDictionary, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print(error)
        return
    }

    guard let files = result else { return }			
    for file in files {
        print("uploaded file name: \(file.key) | file id: \(file.value)")
    }
}

// You can cancel uploading if needed
task.cancel()
```

## Using REST API

Refer to the [REST API documentation][swift-github-docs-rest] for all methods.

Example of getting list of files:

```swift
// Make a query object
let query = PaginationQuery()
    .stored(true)
    .ordering(.sizeDESC)
    .limit(5)
// Make a list of files object
let filesList = uploadcare.list()

// Get file list
filesList.get(withQuery: query) { (list, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print(error)
        return
    }
			
    print(list ?? "")
}
```

Get next page:

```swift
// Check if the next page is available
guard filesList.next != nil else { return }
// Get the next page
filesList.nextPage { (list, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print(error)
        return
    }	
    print(list ?? "")
}
```

Get previous page:

```swift
// Check if the previous page is available
guard filesList.previous != nil else { return }
// Get the previous page
filesList.previousPage { (list, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print(error)
        return
    }	
    print(list ?? "")
}
```
