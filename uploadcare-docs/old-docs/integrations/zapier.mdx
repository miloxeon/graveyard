# Serverless File Uploads with Zapier

[Zapier][ext-zapier-uc-zaps] helps create automated workflows by moving info
between apps. Such workflows are called Zaps, are easy to build and require no
coding skills.

Pick a Zap from the list below to give it a try right away or
[learn more](#insights) about using them.

## Uploadcare Zaps insights
{id="insights"}

Zaps are created using three types of building blocks:

* Triggers watch for events in apps. Once an event occurs, it kicks off a
  sequence of Searches and Actions.
* Searches are there to look up existing data.
* Actions create new items.

You can use the following building blocks with Uploadcare:

* ‚ÄúNew File Uploaded,‚Äù a Trigger that is activated when a new file gets added
  to your Uploadcare project.
* ‚ÄúUpload File,‚Äù an Action that uploads a file to your Uploadcare project.

Note, your Uploadcare project is identified by a unique
[Public Key / Secret Key][settings-keys] pair. This means you can create different
Zaps with a single UC account and even use that account for side projects.

Zapier gives you the power to integrate Uploadcare with _hundreds_ of other apps.
For instance, you can get notified about newly uploaded files in Slack or
automatically add new Dropbox or Google Drive files to Uploadcare.
