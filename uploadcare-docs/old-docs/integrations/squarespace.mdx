# Serverless File Uploads for Squarespace

[Squarespace][ext-squarespace-home] is a platform for building beautiful
websites. With Uploadcare, you can implement powerful serverless file uploads in
any Squarespace project in _6 minutes_.

* [Before We Begin](#before-we-begin)
* [Step 1. Add the Code Block](#add-code-block)
* [Step 2. Add Uploadcare File Uploader](#add-widget)
* [Step 3. Publish Changes](#publish)
* [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## Before We Begin
{id="before-we-begin"}

Before we proceed with integrating file uploading into your Squarespace project,
let’s make sure everything is in place.

The first thing you need is an Uploadcare account. So [Sign Up][account-signup] if
you haven’t done so before. On the [dashboard][dashboard] create a new
project or go to an existing one. Navigate to the “API Keys” section and obtain
your [Public API Key][settings-keys-public].

Sure thing, you need a Squarespace account. Learn about the Squarespace sign-up
flow [here][ext-squarespace-getting-started] or skip this step if you’re already
signed up.

If your Squarespace project implies uploading non-image content, you will have
to provide [billing info][account-billing] in your Uploadcare account.

## Step 1. Add the Code Block
{id="add-code-block"}

In Squarespace, you lay your page out with _blocks_ which stand for various
types of content. You embed our File Uploader as a third-party file uploader using a
_Code Block_. Now, add a code block to your page:

* Hit “Insert Point” or “Add Block.”
* Scroll down to the “MORE” section of the menu.
* Choose the “Code Block” element from the menu.

That’s where you find the “Code Block” element:

    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/074bd660-bc0d-4efb-961f-c9b40480c1c1/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/squarespace-add-block@2x.jpg 2x"

In case you want to learn more about adding blocks, check out the Squarespace
[tutorial][ext-adding-blocks].

## Step 2. Add Uploadcare File Uploader
{id="add-widget"}

First, select _HTML_ in the _Code_ dialog drop-down (this ensures proper HTML
rendering). Then, replace the placeholder with the code snippet:

```html
<!-- Set your Uploadcare Public API Key and get file uploader from CDN. -->

<script>UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY';</script>
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/3.x/uploadcare.full.min.js" data-integration="Wix"></script>

<!-- Build a simple uploads-enabled form. -->

<fieldset>
  <legend>Submit Your Question</legend>
  <form>
    <p>
      <label for="email">E-mail</label>
      <input type="email" id="email" name="email"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      <label for="question">Your question</label>
      <textarea id="question" name="question"></textarea>
    </p>
    <p>
      <label for="images">Your files</label>
      <!--
        The file uploader button appears when you add an input with the specified
        "uploadcare-uploader" role. The additional data-attributes control the
        file uploader behavior. Learn more here:
        https://uploadcare.com/docs/uploads/file-uploader/#configure
      -->
      <input type="hidden" id="files" name="files"
             role="uploadcare-uploader" data-clearable data-images-only data-crop="free,2:3,4:3,16:9" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </p>
  </form>
</fieldset>
```

Don’t forget to replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` with the Public API Key mentioned in
the [Before We Begin](#before-we-begin) section.

Here’s what you get after pasting the snippet:

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/ac5dcf58-9a4e-4168-9ad3-1fd4f3ad8427/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/squarespace-add-widget.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/ac5dcf58-9a4e-4168-9ad3-1fd4f3ad8427/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/squarespace-add-widget@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="Add Uploadcare File Uploader" />

The `data-images-only` attribute in the file uploader input element is an
[option][file-uploader-option-images-only] that allows uploading images only. It’s
there to provide a fail-safe experience for Free Uploadcare accounts with no
billing info added. If you added billing info to your account, remove the data
attribute to handle any file types.

## Step 3. Publish Changes
{id="publish"}

Hit “Apply” to publish your changes. The form you built would then appear on
your page:

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/17c2140d-7c19-4210-8638-2fcf033a65e7/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/squarespace-publish.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/17c2140d-7c19-4210-8638-2fcf033a65e7/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/squarespace-publish@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="Publish Changes" />

That’s it. If you want to tailor the file uploader UI to your page layout, check out
