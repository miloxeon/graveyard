# Color Recognition

Uploadcare Image Transformations features the `main_colors` operation extracting
a specified number of prevailing colors from an image. The operation is
implemented as a URL directive following our general
[image transformations][transformations-image] workflow.

`cdn›-/main_colors/:number_of_colors/`

`main_colors` is useful for analyzing dominant colors of an image, matching
colors between images, building image-based palettes or doing something fancy
with your site or app coloring scheme.

Note, the `main_colors` operation should come last in your image URL.

`:number_of_colors` — a number of prevailing colors you’d like to extract from
an image: a smaller palette is derived, consisting of colors that are a fine
match when representing your input. `:number_of_colors` may be omitted, the
default value of `4` is used in the case.

`main_colors` returns a JSON containing an array of 8-bit RGB values specific to
the found dominant colors.
For example, for [this][ucarecdn-get-colors-example-input] input image, the operation
with no specified parameters will return this JSON,

    "/:uuid/-/preview/-/main_colors/"
  ]}
/>

```json
{
  "width": 2000,
  "main_colors": [
    [138, 142, 143],
    [85, 74, 65],
    [193, 211, 224],
    [49, 42, 36]
  ],
  "height": 2000,
  "id": "/153d750a-049f-44dc-8372-853f49320bad/-/preview/",
  "original": {
    "width": 2000,
    "geo_location": null,
    "orientation": null,
    "datetime_original": null,
    "format": "JPEG",
    "id": "153d750a-049f-44dc-8372-853f49320bad",
    "height": 2000
  }
}
```

Note, the `main_colors` algorithm involves random number generation, which may
lead to slightly different results when applied to a single image repeatedly.

Technically, the operation is an optimized variation of the Local K-means color
image quantization algorithm. The algorithm is adapted to a wide variety of
input image data and provides results intuitive in terms of human perception.
