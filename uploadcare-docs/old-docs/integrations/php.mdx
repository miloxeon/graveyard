# PHP API Client

PHP integration handles uploads and file operations by wrapping Uploadcare
[Upload API][api-reference-upload] and [REST API][api-reference-rest]. This
comprehensive API client lets you use most of the Uploadcare features from within
your PHP app.

Check out an [example project][php-github-sample-project]
that we created as a showcase for various usage scenarios and tasks that you can
resolve.

## Features

Upload features:
* Upload files from local storage and URLs (up to 5 TB)
* Multipart uploading for large files
* Uploading network to speed uploading jobs (like CDN)

File management features:
* Get file info and perform various operations (store/delete/copy) with them
* Work with groups of files 
* Get info about account project
* Manage webhooks
* Convert documents
* Encode and transform videos

Security features:
* Secure authentication
* Secure uploads (signed uploads)
* Secure delivery (authenticated URLs)

## Requirements

* `PHP 7.1 or later`
* `php-curl`
* `php-json`

How to check PHP version via CLI:

```bash
php -v
```

How to check modules:

```bash
php -m
```

You should see `curl` and `json` in the list:

```bash
workstation:home user$ php -m
[PHP Modules]
bcmath
...
curl
...
json
...

[Zend Modules]
```

## Install

Prior to installing `uploadcare-php`, get the [Composer][ext-composer-home]
dependency manager for PHP to simplify installation.

### 1. Update `composer.json`:

```js
"require": {
    "uploadcare/uploadcare-php": "^3.0"
}
```

### 2. Run [Composer][ext-composer-home]:

```bash
php composer.phar update
```

### 3. Define Uploadcare [API keys][settings-keys]:

Add API keys to your configuration object. For example:

```php
# config.php
$_ENV['UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY'] = '<your public key>';
$_ENV['UPLOADCARE_PRIVATE_KEY'] = '<your private key>';
```

### 4. Include Composer's autoload file:

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### 5. Create a `configuration` object

There're a few ways to create a configuration object. We recommend that you use
this static method of the `Uploadcare\Configuration` class:

```php
$configuration = \Uploadcare\Configuration::create('<your public key>', '<your private key>');
```

Alternatively, you can create a Security signature, HTTP client, and Serializer
classes explicitly. After that, you can create a configuration object:

```php
$sign = new \Uploadcare\Security\Signature('<your private key>', 3600); // Must be an instance of \Uploadcare\Interfaces\SignatureInterface
$client = \Uploadcare\Client\ClientFactory::createClient(); // Must be an instance of \GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface
$serializer = new \Uploadcare\Serializer\Serializer(new \Uploadcare\Serializer\SnackCaseConverter()); // Must be an instance of \Uploadcare\Interfaces\Serializer\SerializerInterface

$configuration = new \Uploadcare\Configuration('<your public key>', $sign, $client, $serializer);
```

As you can see, the factory method is more convenient for standard usage.

That's it! All further operations will use this configuration object.

## Usage example

Now that you have Uploadcare PHP API client up and running, you can do the
following:
