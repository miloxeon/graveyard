# Serverless Image Gallery with CDN Delivery

<BadgesBox>
  <Badge>10 Minutes to Integrate</Badge>
</BadgesBox>

[Fotorama][fotorama] is a simple yet powerful image gallery. It supports any
browsers, provides seamless responsive experience and lazy loading images.
By bringing Uploadcare together, you can get your galleries serverless and powered
up with best-in-class <abbr title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</abbr> delivery.

By serving images from Uploadcare, you also enable our
[Image Transformations][transformations-image] engine for your images.

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll get,

  width="100%"
  height="450"
  allowFullScreen="true"
  frameBorder="0" />

This guide will help you learn how to build a serverless image gallery and
apply Image Transformations with a few lines of HTML. It should take you about
_10 minutes_.

* [Step 1. Get Uploadcare Account](#get-uc-account)
* [Step 2. Upload Images](#upload-images)
* [Step 3. Add Fotorama](#fotorama-add)
* [Step 4. Add Image Transformations](#fotorama-edit)
* [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## Step 1. Get Uploadcare Account
{id="get-uc-account"}

First, you will need an Uploadcare account. In case you don‚Äôt have it,
[Sign Up][account-signup] for one, it‚Äôs free. Then, navigate to your
[dashboard][dashboard], go to an existing [project][settings-projects] or
create a new one.

## Step 2. Upload Images
{id="upload-images"}

Switch to ‚ÄúFiles‚Äù in the sidebar. Hit ‚ÄúUpload new files‚Äù and choose images you
want to include in your gallery. We recommend continuing with about four
uploaded images.

Once uploaded, your images will appear on the list of files in your project.
Click any file and see how its URL now looks like:

```cdn{noAutoLinker}
https://ucarecdn.com/:uuid/:filename
```

Once your images are on Uploadcare, we store them for you. From here, you can
manipulate images via their permanent URLs. Let‚Äôs elaborate on the URL
components.

First, the `ucarecdn.com` part indicates an image has already been cached by our
CDN layers. Then, `:uuid` is a unique identifier assigned to your image, and
`:filename` holds its original filename. We won‚Äôt need `:filename` any longer:
your image is now addressable via UUID, i.e., this will work:

```cdn{noAutoLinker}
https://ucarecdn.com/:uuid/
```

We‚Äôll need your new image links to complete further steps of this guide, let‚Äôs
move on to adding Fotorama to your page.

## Step 3. Add Fotorama
{id="fotorama-add"}

Getting Fotorama up and running involves adding some HTML.

This goes to the `<head>` of your page:

```html
<!-- Add jQuery 1.8 or later to your page, 33 KB -->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

<!-- Get Fotorama from CDNJS, 19 KB -->
<link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fotorama/4.6.4/fotorama.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fotorama/4.6.4/fotorama.js"></script>
```

Then, add the `<div>` element with the specified `fotorama` class to the block
of your page where you want the gallery and define image URLs:

```html
<div class="fotorama">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/05f649bf-b70b-4cf8-90f7-2588ce404a08/">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/a9ed82c6-14f1-462e-849e-3b007c2aae87/">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/b7bbb974-b8a1-46f0-82ae-e5a23a136238/">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/150ff289-8b0f-407f-902f-0f224217d225/">
</div>
```

Your gallery will now include four images, however you may notice the images are
too heavy and have different aspect ratios. We can fix this by adding some
[Image Transformations][transformations-image].

## Step 4. Add Image Transformations
{id="fotorama-edit"}

You can modify any image on the fly by simply modifying its URL. We‚Äôll implement
the [`cdn‚Ä∫-/crop/`][transformations-image-crop] and
[`cdn‚Ä∫-/preview/`][transformations-image-preview] transformations to handle image aspect
ratios and sizes:

```html
<div class="fotorama">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/05f649bf-b70b-4cf8-90f7-2588ce404a08/-/crop/4460x3347/336,0/-/preview/">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/a9ed82c6-14f1-462e-849e-3b007c2aae87/-/crop/4480x3360/0,2807/-/preview/">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/b7bbb974-b8a1-46f0-82ae-e5a23a136238/-/crop/5969x4480/469,0/-/preview/">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/150ff289-8b0f-407f-902f-0f224217d225/-/crop/4480x3360/0,3360/-/preview/">
</div>
```

Then, we‚Äôd want the gallery to be responsive and allow it to enter the
fullscreen mode. That‚Äôs done by specifying a couple of data attributes:

```html
<div class="fotorama"
     data-allowfullscreen="native"
     data-width="100%"
     data-ratio="4/3">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/05f649bf-b70b-4cf8-90f7-2588ce404a08/-/crop/4460x3347/336,0/-/preview/">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/a9ed82c6-14f1-462e-849e-3b007c2aae87/-/crop/4480x3360/0,2807/-/preview/">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/b7bbb974-b8a1-46f0-82ae-e5a23a136238/-/crop/5969x4480/469,0/-/preview/">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/150ff289-8b0f-407f-902f-0f224217d225/-/crop/4480x3360/0,3360/-/preview/">
</div>
```

Note, Fotorama provides two ways of handling the fullscreen mode, check out the
‚ÄúFullscreen‚Äù section in their [docs][fotorama-fullscreen]. Getting the image
gallery responsive is a way to handle its ‚ÄúDimensions,‚Äù see this Fotorama
[docs][fotorama-responsive] article for fine-tuning.

Your gallery is now there and ready.

In case you want the gallery to contain image thumbnails rather than the
full-sized originals, you can modify the `<div>` contents in the following manner:

```html
<a href="https://ucarecdn.com/05f649bf-b70b-4cf8-90f7-2588ce404a08/-/crop/4460x3347/336,0/-/preview/">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/05f649bf-b70b-4cf8-90f7-2588ce404a08/-/crop/4460x3347/336,0/-/preview/128x128/" alt="">
</a>
```

Note how we modified the `cdn‚Ä∫-/preview/` Image Transformation parameters: the image
was thus resized to fit in the 128x128px box without changing its original
aspect ratio.

You can learn more about existing Image Transformations in our
[docs][transformations-image]. Specifically, the section about
[Filters][transformations-image-filter].

## Conclusion

That‚Äôs it, you‚Äôve just added a serverless image gallery to your page. It serves
content from CDN and allows manipulating images on the fly üöÄ
