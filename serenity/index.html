				<strong>Serenity</strong> is a private investment fund founded in 2021 by Miloslav A.
				Voloskov. We focus on long-term investments in ventures of proven intrinsic value to
				provide maximum possible financial security.
			</p>
			<p>
				Serenity helps people achieve and maintain good <strong>financial behavior</strong>,
				akin to eating behavior in psychology. Backers report decreased
				<em>binge spending</em> and relieved financial anxiety.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				You're a genius. The financial behavior thing works just as expected.

			</blockquote>
			<p>Our values are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Achieving high degree of <strong>diversification</strong> to overcome local market
					instabilities. One stock may dip, but the fund will stay afloat.
				</li>
				<li>
					Carefully analyzing companies to prove their value and growth opportunities. We
					invest in companies that make money every day and rely on their
					<strong>customers</strong>, not investors.
				</li>
				<li>
					Accumulating assets to maximize <strong>financial security</strong> for our
					investors.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Who invests with Serenity?</h2>
			<p>
				High-profile software developers and designers, IT team leaders and managers, curators,
				sole founders, young startup executives. People who are passionate about what they do,
				but are not necessarily passionate about finance management and analyzing the stock
				market.
			</p>
			<p>
				Generally speaking, our clients are people who already have sources of substantial
				personal income, but are not yet bound by complex financial and corporate policies.
			</p>
			<h2>Why choose Serenity?</h2>
			<p>
				Serenity pays <strong>dividends</strong>. On the day of payment, Serenity calculates
				every backer's share to distribute dividends accordingly. By default, dividends are
				re-invested, but regular payouts are also an option.
			</p>
			<p>
				We make money on transparent, clear commission charges. Commissions are calculated
				individually.
			</p>
			<h2>What's the strategy?</h2>
			<p>We invest in stocks. We choose stocks based on three fundamental values:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Proven, sustainable business model. Earnings should be real and proven in a long run.
					Companies that lose money are out of question, no matter how hyped they are.
				</li>
				<li>
					Clear growth opportunities. If a company sells thousands of goods to millions of
					people every single day, that's a good company.
				</li>
				<li>
					Diversification. If an asset promises good revenue, portfolio balance shouldn't be
					neglected.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				After carefully analyzing the market, we decided to scrap ETFs altogether. A fund that
				resells other funds brings little to no value to the table, so we only invest in actual
				assets. Options, shady cryptocurrencies, penny stocks and other speculative endeavors
				are also avoided.
