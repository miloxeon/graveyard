# Android API Client and File Uploader

Android (Kotlin and Java) integration handles uploads and file operations by
wrapping Uploadcare [Upload API][api-reference-upload] and [REST API][api-reference-rest].
This comprehensive API client lets you use most of the Uploadcare features from
within your Android app. It also includes a native File Uploader widget.

[GitHub &rarr;][android-github]

## Features

Concise and easy-to-use library without extra resources and drawables.

Upload features:
* Upload files from a file, byte array, URL, URI and cloud sources (up to 5 TB)
* Multipart uploading for large files
* Uploading network to speed uploading jobs (like CDN)

File Uploader UI:
* Upload files from a local disk, camera, and cloud sources
* Track, pause and continue multipart uploading
* Background uploading
* Bulk file uploading
* Material design Uploader appearance customization and styles

File management features:
* Get file info and perform various operations (store/delete/copy) with them
* Work with groups of files 
* Get info about account project
* Manage webhooks
* Convert documents
* Encode and transform videos
* Paginated resource fetching
* Synchronous and asynchronous operation modes
* CDN path builder

Security features:
* Secure authentication
* Secure uploads (signed uploads)
* Secure delivery (authenticated URLs)

## Installation from jCenter

The latest stable versions are available at jCenter.

To include API client and File Uploader Widget in your Android project, add
this line to the 'gradle.build' file:

```
implementation 'com.uploadcare.android.library:uploadcare-android:3.1.0'
implementation 'com.uploadcare.android.widget:uploadcare-android-widget:3.1.0'
```

## Initialization

REST API requires both public and secret keys. If you use Upload API only, you
can specify just "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY". Get your Public and Secret API Keys in your
project's [Dashboard][dashboard].

Kotlin
```kotlin
val uploadcare = UploadcareClient("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY", "YOUR_SECRET_KEY")
```
Java
```java
UploadcareClient uploadcare = new UploadcareClient("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY", "YOUR_SECRET_KEY");
```

For File Uploader Widget, place your Uploadcare public/private keys into ../res/strings.xml file:

```xml
<resources>
    <!--Replace with your public/private keys to use UploadcareWidget. Private key is optional, required only if you use Rest API features.-->
    <string name="uploadcare_public_key" translatable="false">place_uploadcare_public_key_here</string>
    <string name="uploadcare_private_key" translatable="false">place_uploadcare_private_key_here</string>
</resources>
```

## Using REST API

You can use both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

### File info
#### Asynchronous file info fetch

Kotlin
```kotlin
uploadcare.getFileAsync(
        context, // Context
        "YOUR_FILE_UUID", // File UUID
        object : UploadcareFileCallback {
            override fun onFailure(e: UploadcareApiException) {
                // Handle errors.
            }

            override fun onSuccess(result: UploadcareFile) {
                // Successfully fetched file.
            }
        })
```

Java
```java
uploadcare.getFileAsync(
        context, // Context
        "YOUR_FILE_UUID", // File UUID
        new UploadcareFileCallback() {
            @Override
            public void onFailure(@NotNull UploadcareApiException e) {
                // Handle errors.
            }

            @Override
            public void onSuccess(@NonNull UploadcareFile result) {
                // Successfully fetched file.
            }
        });
```

#### Synchronous file info fetch

Kotlin
```kotlin
val file = uploadcare.getFile("YOUR_FILE_UUID")
```

Java
```java
UploadcareFile file = uploadcare.getFile("YOUR_FILE_UUID");
```

## Using Upload API

You can use both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

### Upload file
#### Asynchronous file upload

Kotlin
```kotlin
val context = ...// Context
val fileUri = ...//resource representing file (File/Uri/InputStream/ByteArray/String types are supported).
val uploader = FileUploader(uploadcare, fileUri, context) // Use "MultipleFilesUploader" for multiple files.
    .store(true)
    // Other upload parameters.

uploader.uploadAsync(object : UploadFileCallback {
    override fun onFailure(e: UploadcareApiException) {
        // Handle errors.
    }

    override fun onProgressUpdate(
                        bytesWritten: Long,
                        contentLength: Long,
                        progress: Double) {
        // Upload progress info.
    }

    override fun onSuccess(result: UploadcareFile) {
        // Successfully uploaded file to Uploadcare.
    }
})

// Cancel upload in progress.
uploader.cancel()
```

Java
```java
Context context = ...// Context
Uri fileUri = ...//resource representing file (File/Uri/InputStream/ByteArray/String types are supported).
Uploader uploader = new FileUploader(uploadcare, fileUri, context) // Use "MultipleFilesUploader" for multiple files.
    .store(true);
    // Other upload parameters.

uploader.uploadAsync(new UploadFileCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onFailure(UploadcareApiException e) {
        // Handle errors.
    }

    @Override
    public void onProgressUpdate(
                        Long bytesWritten,
                        Long contentLength,
                        Double progress) {
        // Upload progress info.
    }

    @Override
    public void onSuccess(UploadcareFile file) {
        // Successfully uploaded file to Uploadcare.
    }
});

// Cancel upload in progress.
uploader.cancel();
```

#### Synchronous file upload

Kotlin
```kotlin
val context = ...// Context
val fileUri = ...//resource representing file (File/Uri/InputStream/ByteArray/String types are supported).
val uploader = FileUploader(uploadcare, fileUri, context) // Use "MultipleFilesUploader" for multiple files.
    .store(true)
    // Other upload parameters.

try {
    val file = uploader.upload()
    // Successfully uploaded file to Uploadcare.
} catch (e: UploadFailureException) {
    // Handle errors.
}
```

Java
```java
Context context = ...// Context
Uri fileUri = ...//resource representing file (File/Uri/InputStream/ByteArray/String types are supported).
Uploader uploader = new FileUploader(uploadcare, fileUri, context) // Use "MultipleFilesUploader" for multiple files.
    .store(true);
    // Other upload parameters.

try {
    UploadcareFile file = uploader.upload();
    // Successfully uploaded file to Uploadcare.
} catch (UploadFailureException e) {
    // Handle errors.
}
```

## Using File Uploader Widget
### Select and upload file from any available local file/camera/external source from Activity/Fragment

Kotlin
```kotlin
// Launch UploadcareWidget
val fragment = this //or val activity = this;
UploadcareWidget.getInstance()
                .selectFile(fragment)
                //set other parameters for upload
                .launch()

// Handle result
override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)

    val result = UploadcareWidgetResult.fromIntent(data)
    result?.let {
        //handle result.
    }
}
```

Java
```java
// Launch UploadcareWidget
Fragment fragment = this; //or Activity activity = this;
UploadcareWidget.getInstance()
                .selectFile(fragment)
                //set other parameters for upload
                .launch();

// Handle result
@Override
public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, @Nullable Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);

    UploadcareWidgetResult result = UploadcareWidgetResult.fromIntent(data);
    if(result != null){
        //handle result.
    }
}
```
