# Angular 2+ File Uploader

Receive files from your users with a clean, lightweight and easy-to-integrate
widget. This Angular component helps you integrate
[Uploadcare Widget][feature-file-uploader] into your Angular app natively.

[GitHub &rarr;][ngx-github]

## Features

* Upload files from a local disk, camera, and cloud source (up to 5 TB)
* Multipart uploading for large files
* Bulk file uploading
* In-browser image editing
* Uploading network to speed uploading jobs (like CDN)

## Integration

Run this command in your project’s directory:

```bash
npm install ngx-uploadcare-widget
```

Once you’re done with the installation, import File Uploader into your project.
For new Angular projects, you can open the file `/src/app/app.module.ts` in a
text editor and insert this line:

```js
import { UcWidgetModule } from 'ngx-uploadcare-widget';
```

After that, include the module in the `imports` section of your project’s
module:

```js
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...,
    UcWidgetModule,
  ],
  ...
})
...
```

If you work with an existing project, then you’ll need to do the same in
the part of your app where you want to use the integration. If you are unsure,
stick with `/src/app/app.module.ts`.

That’s how `app.module.ts` should look like after your changes:

## Test

You are now ready to add File Uploader to some page and try using it.

Insert the following lines in one of the `something.component.html` files of
your project (or in `/src/app/app.component.html` for new projects):

```html
<ngx-uploadcare-widget
  images-only="true"
  public-key="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY">
</ngx-uploadcare-widget>
```

If you want to to go with the customized File Uploader look use this element:

```html
<ngx-uploadcare-widget-custom
  images-only="true"
  public-key="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY">
</ngx-uploadcare-widget-custom>
```

Don’t forget to replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` with an actual
[Public API Key][settings-keys-public] from your Uploadcare project's
[dashboard][dashboard].

Save the file and let the Angular serve itself:

```bash
ng serve --open
```

Uploadcare File Uploader will load like this:

## Settings

File Uploader integration for Angular 2+ is highly customizable. You can use all
the attributes listed in the [readme][ngx-github-readme]. Learn more about File
Uploader options here in[docs][file-uploader-options].

For example, this is how you allow uploading files only from local storage and
URLs via the `data-tabs` attribute:

```html
<ngx-uploadcare-widget
  images-only="true"
  data-tabs="file url"
  public-key="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY">
</ngx-uploadcare-widget>
```
