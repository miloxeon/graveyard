# Watermarks, Build Cover for Your Images

<BadgesBox>
  <Badge>5 Minutes to Integrate</Badge>
</BadgesBox>

Quite often we see that some image on the web is protected with watermarks
(i.e. logos or symbols applied over an image).
A watermark is created as a separate layer that is then merged
with the original image.

One way to watermark an image is to use an image processing software
in manual or automatic mode. Another way is a near-real time on-demand image processing
— a concept we cultivate within our CDN.

In the latter case, a watermark is applied to an image through the
[overlay][transformations-image-overlays] operation.
In short, the operation allows users to layer images.

## Now, to the hands-on examples
{id="wmarks-intro"}

If you’d like to experiment with your own examples, make sure that,

* You’re already registered with Uploadcare. In case you aren’t, [signing up][account-signup].
* You’ve already got some images you’d like to become watermark-added within an Uploadcare project.
* You’ve prepared and uploaded to your Uploadcare project some images
  that you’d like to become watermarks (the ones you’d like to layer over other images).

Okay, the images are at hand — let’s go. Basically, in order to apply a watermark
to an image, you only need to construct a proper URL. Since we’re only going
to be working with URLs, this can be a truly fun and interactive tutorial.
The image we will be applying a watermark to is this one (let’s refer to it as just 'pineapple'),

`/22240276-2f06-41f8-9411-755c8ce926ed/-/preview/640x480/`

![initial image][ucarecdn-initial-image]

Full-sized images from the CDN can be accessed via a
[direct link][ucarecdn-direct-link],
while their processed versions contain operations in the
[URLs][ucarecdn-url-operations-example].
Please, refer to our [Image Transformations][transformations-image] reference for
more.

## Basic syntax
{id="wmarks-syntax"}

All the cool things with our CDN are made using operations,
and `overlay` is an operation too. Its syntax goes like this,

`cdn›-/overlay/:uuid/:relative_dimensions/:position/:opacity/`

Look at the code string above and mind the two separators used within
Uploadcare CDN operations: a forward slash `/` is used to divide parameters of operations,
while a dash in between the two forward slashes `/-/` is used to split off image UUIDs and/or operations.
We’re going to use the leading `cdn›-/` to tell operations from parameters.

The parameters of the `overlay` operation are marked with a `:colon`.
The sequence of the parameters is important, every parameter is optional and can be omitted.

Now, let’s talk about what the parameters do.

## `:uuid`
{id="wmarks-identifier"}

A UUID is used to specify an image within our CDN.
Please note, that in order to be recognized by its `:uuid`,
a watermark image should be related to the same account as the original image.
Here, let’s unveil the overlay we’d like to be put over the pineapple,

`cdn›-/overlay/b18b5179-b9f6-4fdc-9920-5539f938fc44/`

![simple overlay usage][ucarecdn-simple-overlay-usage]

As you see, the overlay image is presented in its original size,
is opaque, and positioned in the top-left corner of the underlying image.
We can change all of those using the following parameters.

## `:relative_dimensions`
{id="wmarks-dimensions"}

As the name implies, this parameter enables users to scale an overlay.
The two supported scaling modes can be defined as *static* and *dynamic*.
The first stands for setting the overlay size in pixels
(aspect ratio is always preserved, so you define the maximum size along one of its axes).
It works like this,

`cdn›-/overlay/b18b5179-b9f6-4fdc-9920-5539f938fc44/800x800/`

![changing dimensions][ucarecdn-changing-dimensions]

Yup, we see that the size is affected.
Another option would be to use *dynamic* scaling,
where the size of an overlay is derived from the dimensions of an underlying image.
This mode is enabled simply by using percent format in the expression:

`cdn›-/overlay/b18b5179-b9f6-4fdc-9920-5539f938fc44/80%x80%/`

![changing dimensions, percent format][ucarecdn-changing-dimensions-percent-format]

Ah, there’s a trick, though, since `%` is an escape char in URLs,
it can’t be used as-is and should be replaced with
either `%25` escape sequence or a more concise `p` char.

## `:position`
{id="wmarks-position"}

This parameter controls the positioning of an overlay on top of the original image.
Again, either pixel (as an offset from the top-left corner) or percent format can be used.
The coordinates within the parameter are separated by a coma. See the examples,

Pixel format: `cdn›-/overlay/b18b5179-b9f6-4fdc-9920-5539f938fc44/128,128/`

![changing dimensions, pixel format][ucarecdn-changing-dimensions-pixel-format]

Percent format: `cdn›-/overlay/b18b5179-b9f6-4fdc-9920-5539f938fc44/80p,80p/`

![changing dimensions, percent format][ucarecdn-changing-dimensions-percent-format]

Please note, that when using the percent format you define coordinates
within the difference between maximum dimensions of an overlay and an underlying image.

## `:opacity`
{id="wmarks-opacity"}

This parameter lets you adjust how transparent an overlay is.
That’s especially useful for watermarks.

What you control with the parameter is a percentage-based degree of image opacity.
The syntax is straight-forward (the example shows a 30% watermark over our pineapple),

`cdn›-/overlay/b18b5179-b9f6-4fdc-9920-5539f938fc44/30p/`

![controlling opacity][ucarecdn-controlling-opacity]

## Mixed use
{id="wmarks-params-multiple"}

Now that we’ve learned how to use the listed techniques effectively,
it’s quite obvious that all of the `:overlay` parameters can be used together.
This means a watermark of our preference can be moved, resized, and made transparent.
Let’s make a great URL for that,

`cdn›-/overlay/b18b5179-b9f6-4fdc-9920-5539f938fc44/60px60p/10p,50p/30p/`

![mixed parameter usage][ucarecdn-mixed-parameter-usage]

Withal, we aren’t placing any restrictions on the overall number of overlays per request
— this means you can layer as many watermarks over an image as you like.
In this example, we use different coordinates and opacity settings for each of the four overlays,

`cdn›-/overlay/efd02791-7511-42e9-850d-3b3d07f110ae/35px35p/10p,10p/40p/-/overlay/b18b5179-b9f6-4fdc-9920-5539f938fc44/35px35p/70p,5p/35p/-/overlay/b18b5179-b9f6-4fdc-9920-5539f938fc44/35px35p/15p,70p/55p/-/overlay/efd02791-7511-42e9-850d-3b3d07f110ae/35px35p/80p,90p/50p/-/preview/640x480/`

![numerous overlays][ucarecdn-numerous-overlays]

## Overlay magic
{id="wmarks-magic"}

Another ace-high point which you might find useful is
that the `overlay` operation is always performed last. Here’s what we mean,

`cdn›-/overlay/:uuid/60px60p/20p,80p/80p/-/blur/70/`

![overlay over the blurred image][ucarecdn-overlay-over-the-blurred-image]

Yes, even though the overlay operation comes first in the URL,
it will be performed last. Swoopy — an overlay would still be placed over an image
even if it got cropped or otherwise processed.

## Conclusion and a bit of a benchmark
{id="wmarks-benchmark"}

Tests have shown that it only took about 20 ms to add an overlay to a small
([0.2 MP][ucarecdn-0-2-mp])
image and only about 90 ms to a mid-sized one
([3 MP][ucarecdn-3-mp])
— a swell result, but there will be a further boost in loading time once the images will be cached by our CDN.

Actually, watermarks are one of the most obvious `overlay` usages.
There’s more to it, and we’d like you to explore the technical
and artistic capabilities of the feature. We hope you are enjoying your Uploadcare experience.
