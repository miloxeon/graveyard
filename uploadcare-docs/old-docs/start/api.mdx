# API Overview

Uploadcare API provides a single point of control for the entire infrastructure:

Here is the example of using our domain-specific language so you can get the idea right away:

```cdn{noAutoLinker}
https://ucarecdn.com/[UUID]/-/crop/200x300/center/
```

<p>
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/5651bbb6-c599-44bd-9c63-1db5e67db6ad/-/crop/200x300/center/" alt="Center image and crop to size"/>
</p>

```cdn{noAutoLinker}
https://ucarecdn.com/[UUID]/-/resize/400x/-/effect/grayscale/
```

<p>
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/5651bbb6-c599-44bd-9c63-1db5e67db6ad/-/resize/400x/-/effect/grayscale/" alt="Grayscale image effect (black and white)"/>
</p>

[**→** Image transformations][transformations-image]

## File Uploader API
{id="file-uploader-api"}

This is a set of tools allowing you to adjust our File Uploader
behavior and implement advanced workflows like moderating uploaded content or
playing with the file uploader appearance. You can also use certain methods of the API without the file uploader, as standalone components.

## Versioning

When we introduce backward-incompatible changes into File Uploader and
REST API, we release new major versions. Once published, such versions are
supported for a limited time period. This section combines versions, their
publishing dates, and support terms.

The support length for each new release of Uploadcare File Uploader and REST API is
_2 years_. The two-year support term for current versions starts when we release
the new ones. We will update this document, our changelog, and notify you via
email about new releases.

The latest stable versions are:
* Uploadcare File Uploader: _3.11.0_
* REST API: _0.5_

<!-- The complete log of changes can be found in the platform
[Changelog][changelog] under the tags [“widget”][changelog-widget] (for File Uploader) and
[“rest api”][changelog-rest]. -->
