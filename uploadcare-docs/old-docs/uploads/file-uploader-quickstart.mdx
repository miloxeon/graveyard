# File Uploader Quick Start

Uploading is one of the fundamental concepts of Uploadcare, an end-to-end file
handling platform. The uploading experience starts with
[Uploadcare File Uploader][file-uploader], an ultimate File Uploader.
This section covers how you jump straight into action.

What you get in the end is a uploader button in a specific spot of your page.
Hitting the button activates the uploading dialog driven by tabbed navigation.

Here, the button goes like this,

<Widget />

The File Uploader allows you to choose files from over a dozen sources,
handle multiple files in one go, implement our Distributed Upload Network, and
more.

While you can learn more about File Uploader [dependencies][file-uploader-install-dependencies] and
[installation][file-uploader-install] in another section, the simplest implementation
would go like this:

Discover a page you would like the File Uploader to appear on. Navigate to its `<head>`,
and put the following snippet there:

```html
<script>UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY = "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY";</script>
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/3.x/uploadcare.full.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

The first `<script>` element here sets the target Uploadcare project for your
uploads by defining the `UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY` parameter.
Replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` with a [Public API Key][settings-keys-public] of the
project you want to use with the File Uploader. This requires you to
[Sign Up][account-signup] and discover the API key under project settings around
the [Dashboard][dashboard].
You can also set `UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY` to the `"demopublickey"` value which
points to the Uploadcare demo account and does not require signing up for
Uploadcare. Just note we wipe out all the files on our demo account every 24
hours.

The second `<script>` in the example above performs the
[CDN install][file-uploader-install-cdn] of the “full” File Uploader bundle, minified. You
might want to learn more about File Uploader [bundle types][file-uploader-install-bundles] or
available [install methods][file-uploader-install].

<!-- GONE TO INDEX.MD / Uploads / Uploader / Install

Once you are done setting your public key and choosing an appropriate bundle,
look through your page `<body>` and see where you want the File Uploader button to
appear. Place the following `<input>` element there and make sure not to miss
the `name` attribute:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" name="my_file" />
``` -->

That’s it. From here, our File Uploader will work as a simple form element
allowing folk around your page to upload files of any types and sizes. You can
always learn more about in-depth uploader configuration [here][file-uploader-config].

In case you don’t feel like putting `<script>` elements here and there, check
out other [install methods][file-uploader-install] like [NPM][file-uploader-install-npm] or
head straight over to our [integrations][integrations].
