# JavaScript API — Handling Custom Tabs

Beside the built-in file uploader tabs like `file`, `url`, `dropbox`, etc. there is an
option of implementing a tab with a custom behavior. This is a relatively
complex yet powerful way to customize the dialog.

## Registering a new tab
{id="register"}

When you want to add a custom tab, you should first register it with a given
`name`, which can then be used in your [tabs][file-uploader-option-tabs] list.

```js
uploadcare.registerTab(name, constructor);
```

`constructor` is a function that is called to create a new tab.

## Custom Tabs constructor
{id="constructor"}

A constructor is called every time a new dialog is opened. Here is how you
declare it:

```js
function myTab(container, button, dialogApi, settings, name) {
  ...
}
```

Where,

* `container` is a jQuery object holding your main tab element.
* `button` is a jQuery object with your tab button.
* `dialogApi` is an [object][api-reference-js-dialog-panel](#dialog-api) holding
  methods to control your dialog.
* `settings` is a [settings object][file-uploader-config-object].
* `name` is a name used when registering a tab and in the
  [tabs][file-uploader-option-tabs] list.

Note, a single constructor can be registered under several names. You can find
more examples in our [file uploader customization][file-uploader-custom-tabs]
tutorial.
