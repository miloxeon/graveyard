# WordPress File Uploader and Adaptive Delivery Plugin

[WordPress platform][ext-wordpress-platform] is open-source and free to use,
yet it's just a CMS part of your blog or a website. It doesn't come with a free
hosting plan. For example, [wordpress.com][ext-wordpress-home] offers
[paid][ext-wordpress-plans] hosting.

Uploadcare, all-round media upload, storage, management, and delivery solution,
breaks many WordPress Media Library limitations. Upload large files from many
sources including social media and cloud services. Insert them to WordPress
posts and serve responsive lazy loaded images with Uploadcare CDN to improve
your WordPress site performance.

This plugin allows WordPress authors upload images and other files with
Uploadcare File Uploader while creating posts and pages. You can migrate your
current Media Library to your Uploadcare storage, use Adaptive Delivery and
other Uploadcare features.

## Features

* Upload files of any type (image, video, document, archive) and size (up to 5
  TB).
* Upload from your device, URL, social network (Facebook, Instagram, VK,
  Flickr), and cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Photos, OneDrive, Box,
  Huddle, Evernote).
* Insert images into your posts, and place other files and archives for
  download.
* Uploadcare CDN serves images faster in all parts of the world. Adaptive
  Delivery analyzes usersâ€™ context and serves images in a suitable format,
  resolution, compression, which closes all image-related frontend tasks.
* Transfer your existing Media Library to your Uploadcare storage with no risk
  of data loss.
* Specify your custom CDN domain, and use a Secure Uploading feature to control
  who and when can upload files.
* Compatible with a standard WordPress image editor.

## Prerequisites

An installed [WordPress instance][ext-wordpress-platform] or a paid plan at
[WordPress.com][ext-wordpress-home] that supports plugins.

The current version of the Uploadcare plugin 3.x works with the latest WordPress
versions 5.x and supports the new visual [Gutenberg][ext-gutenberg] post editor.
Also, it brings Uploadcare features, such as
[Adaptive Delivery][adaptive-delivery-product-page] into your WordPress.

[An account at Uploadcare][account-signup]. For testing purposes, you can use
both a Free plan or a Trial to any of the paid plans. Learn how to [sign
up][uploadcare-signup] at Uploadcare.

## Installation

Log in to your WordPress admin panel `https://yoursite.com/wp-admin`.

There is an official [Uploadcare plugin][ext-wordpress-plugins-uploadcare] for
WordPress that you can find in the plugin list.

    type='video/mp4'
  />
</Video>

To install the plugin, go to **Plugins**, **Add New**, and search for
"Uploadcare". **Install** and **Activate** it.

## Settings

Now, you need to link your WordPress plugin with your Uploadcare account. There
are API Keys for that (Public and Secret Keys). Get them from your Uploadcare
projet's [Dashboard][dashboard] and insert them into the respective fields
in the Plugin settings.

    type='video/mp4'
  />
</Video>

Go to **Settings** > **Uploadcare**. Open your project's **Dashboard** in a new
tab. Copy your **Public Key** from the upper-right corner and paste it in the
respective field of your WordPress settings tab.

Next, go back to your Dashboard for **a Secret Key**. Select **API keys** from
the left menu and generate a new Secret Key. Copy it (or download it as a text
file) and use it with your WordPress.

Tip: The rule of thumb is that one **Secret Key** works for one integration
with a service (e.g., WordPress). Generate more keys are delete them as you
need. This is how you manage integrations.

## Use Uploadcare Image

While editing a post, you can add a new block, select **Uploadcare image**.

    type='video/mp4'
  />

Use the desired upload source: local files, social networks, etc. This image
upload will go to your project storage at Uploadcare that you've integrated with
WordPress. Also, it'll be listed in your WordPress Media Library as well.

Edit images after uploading or anytime later. You can customize the
[File Uploader][feature-file-uploader] in the plugin settings. For example,
select only upload sources you're going to use. Also, you can customize the
[Editing features][fxtab].

### Preview

Uploaded images will be delivered via Uploadcare CDN on preview and when you
publish the post. The [Adaptive Delivery][adaptive-delivery-product-page]
feature kicks in here and optimizes images on the fly depending on the
client's device and browser. It includes `srcset` auto-creation for responsive
images, lazy loading, etc.

Check out the stats for this page. All WordPress text and script content is
loaded from the original domain, and the image is loaded from ucarecdn.com. It's
size is 105.70 KB while the original file was 9.9 MB.

## Managing Media Library

It's also possible to do file and image uploading via Uploadcare right from your
Media Library.

    type='video/mp4'
  />

Either way, Uploadcare images will be stored in your project's storage and
listed in Media Library as external images.

## Summary

With the Uploadcare plugin, you can upload large files, insert images and edit
them right in your WordPress posts. It powers up your WordPress content creation
experience and backs up with a secure cloud storage and CDN delivery.
