# üçå Extensio
Bare minimum browser extension boilerplate.

Extensio allows you to create a bare minimum browser extension that can just inject your code into websites that user visits. This is enough for most of the basic extensions.

# Usage

1. Make your own repository out of this template
2. Add your code to `app.js`
3. Enter the extensions developer mode in your browser and add your repo folder. It will show up near other installed extensions and will be ready to run
4. (optional) Publish your extension to browser extensions stores
