# Delivery

<LeadParagraph>Every uploaded file is immediately available on the Uploadcare CDN.</LeadParagraph>

The network provides fast and reliable file delivery across the world via
500,000 nodes. Each file at Uploadcare has a UUID by which it’s available on the
CDN:

```cdn
https://ucarecdn.com/017162da-e83b-46fc-89fc-3a7740db0a82/
```

## Image transformations

Uploadcare CDN isn’t just a file delivery network. It can process images on the
fly, which means that transformations are applied instantly when requested.

```cdn
