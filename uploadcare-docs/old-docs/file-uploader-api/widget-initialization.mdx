# File Uploader Initialization

This article comes in handy when you want to alter the default file uploader
initialization behavior. That can be done to get more control over file uploader on
your system and has to do with the two following boolean parameters:

* `UPLOADCARE_MANUAL_START`, the [option][file-uploader-option-manual-start] which
  defaults to `false` and controls the start of file uploader initialization.
* `UPLOADCARE_LIVE`, the [option][file-uploader-option-live] which defaults to `true`
  and controls the character of that initialization.

This means that by default file uploaders are initialized during your page load. And,
every ~100 ms we check if there are any new inputs with the specific role
`[role=uploadcare-uploader]`.

## Automatic vs manual init
{id="autoinit"}

All file uploaders on your page are initialized during its load, which may not be the
desired behavior when you want to do something before the page load. That is
when the [`UPLOADCARE_MANUAL_START`][file-uploader-option-manual-start] option comes in
together with `uploadcare.start()`.
You should pass the `settings` [object][file-uploader-config-object]
into `uploadcare.start()` to override [global settings][file-uploader-config-globals].
However, you can still pass any global settings, but keep in mind that
`settings` keys are `camelCased`, not `CAPITALIZED_WITH_UNDERSCORES`:

```js
UPLOADCARE_MANUAL_START = true;

jQuery(function($) {
  var $.getJSON('/uploadcare.json', function(data) {
    uploadcare.start({
      publicKey: data.publicKey, // overrides UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY
      crop: data.crop // overrides UPLOADCARE_CROP
    });
  });
});
```

See [`UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY`][file-uploader-option-pubkey] and
[`UPLOADCARE_CROP`][file-uploader-option-crop] for details about the snippet above.

## Checking for new inputs
{id="new-inputs"}

By default, new `[role=uploadcare-uploader]` elements on your page are
initialized as file uploaders in every ~100 ms. Such behavior is caused by a single
JavaScript timer. It shouldnâ€™t have any performance impact in typical
applications.

However, if you would like to alter this behavior, consider disabling the
[`UPLOADCARE_LIVE`][file-uploader-option-live] option. Then, you will have to
[manually init][api-reference-javascript] any new inputs with the specified
role.
