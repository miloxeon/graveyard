# Transformations

[Transformations][transformations-product-page] help you perform media
processing on the server. You can apply different transformations to images,
videos and documents. All operations are non-desctructive so your original files
stay intact.

## Image Transformations
{id="image-transformations"}

[Image Transformations][transformations-image] help you resize, optimize,
stylize images, create responsive images, etc. You can stack several
transformations and tweak parameters. Image transformations are applied at the
moment of a user request to that image over the CDN URL with the transformation
directives.

## Video Processing
{id="video-processing"}

Uploadcare Video Processing optimizes your video content delivery. It works via
the [REST API][api-reference-rest] by posting a processing request. In addition
to encoding videos, you can apply
[Video Transformations][transformations-video-processiing] to adjust video
quality, format, and size with CDN URL directives.

## Document Conversion
{id="document-conversion"}

Uploadcare allows converting documents to the following target formats: DOC,
DOCX, XLS, XLSX, ODT, ODS, RTF, TXT, PDF, JPG, PNG. Document Conversion works
via the [REST API][api-reference-rest]. After the conversion is performed, you 
can address the outputs via the respective CDN URLs.
