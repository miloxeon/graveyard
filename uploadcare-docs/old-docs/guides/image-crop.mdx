# Image Crop for Web and Mobile

<BadgesBox>
  <Badge>9 Minutes to Integrate</Badge>
</BadgesBox>

Cropping images is a common task and an everyday routine for producing content.
We believe image crop should happen right in your browser and be intuitive and
simple. Firing a dedicated image editor to do the cropping is an overkill.

This tutorial is about enabling your users to crop images in any browser with
Uploadcare, no matter the device or browser they use.

You can get this up and running in _10 minutes_ with our
[file uploader][file-uploader]. The uploader is a file uploader written in
JavaScript; you can customize it to fit your app look and user experience.

There are three simple steps to take:

* [Step 1. Set Up Your Uploadcare Account and Project](#signup)
* [Step 2. Pick Where You Want the Crop](#pick)
* [Step 3. Integrate the File Uploader](#integrate)

## Step 1. Set Up Your Uploadcare Account and Project
{id="signup"}

In case you don‚Äôt have an Uploadcare account, [Sign Up][account-signup] for one.
Once you get it, navigate to your [dashboard][dashboard] to create a new
[project][settings-projects] or discover [API keys][settings-keys] for an existing
one.

You will only need the [Public API Key][settings-keys-public] that points to
a target project where the images will go to.

## Step 2. Pick Where You Want the Crop
{id="pick"}

Pick a form in your web app where you want users to crop images. It could be a
profile editing form, image upload form, etc.

Note, our file uploader enables your users to upload images from their camera, social
media, cloud storage, and more. We call those ‚ÄúUpload Sources,‚Äù and you can
learn more about them in our [docs][file-uploader-upload-sources].

## Step 3. Integrate the File Uploader
{id="integrate"}

You install the file uploader by adding a couple of `<script>` elements to your page
`<head>`. It comes in a variety of [bundles][file-uploader-install-bundles] and is
usually served from our <abbr title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</abbr>.

Here‚Äôs how it goes. First, add this to your page `<head>`:

```html
<script>UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'your_public_key';</script>
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/3.7.3/uploadcare.full.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

Next, place this `<input>` where you want our widgfile uploaderet to appear on your page:

```html
<input
  name="your_form_field_name"
  value=""
  type="hidden"
  role="uploadcare-uploader"
  data-images-only
  data-crop
  />
```

The file uploader looks for inputs with `role="uploadcare-uploader"` and places its
button there.

Note, the `value` attribute may either be empty or contain a CDN URL or UUID of
an image on Uploadcare. The non-empty `value` will preload a file into your
file uploader dialog. Otherwise, your users will be prompted to load a file from one
of the enabled Upload Sources. You can learn more about default files in the
file uploader dialog in our [docs][file-uploader-predefined-files].

That‚Äôs what you should get by now:

<Widget
  imagesOnly
  crop
  urlBase="https://upload.uploadcare.com/"
  publicKey="232d896709883f79bfaf"
  value="9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1"
/>

Once you‚Äôre done cropping, your image CDN URL gets updated with the
`crop` [Image Transformation][transformations-image-crop]. The file uploader then passes
the updated CDN URL to the input `value`, and from there you can use it for
other routines.

That‚Äôs how the updated CDN URL may look like:

```md
http://ucarecdn.com/9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1/-/crop/400x400/500,500/cropout.jpg
```

You can define the file uploader crop presets by specifying the
[`data-crop`][file-uploader-option-crop] attribute. This is useful when you want
specific aspect ratios, image dimensions, etc.

## Yoohoo, That‚Äôs it üöÄ

You‚Äôve just enabled image crop in your app via Uploadcare without breaking a
sweat. Great job!

section on [file uploader styling][file-uploader-styling].
