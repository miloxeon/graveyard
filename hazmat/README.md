# 🥽 Hazmat 
**We are what we eat.**

With ever evolving digital generation, the above phrase has evolved into: **We think based on what we consume.** Our thought process has huge impact on how we lead our lives. A good one only fuels growth.


There is an overwhelming amount of information available for consumption at the tap of a button. Not all of it is accurate, useful, or healthy for our minds.


When we are conscious about what we read, listen to, watch, or interact with on internet, we can significantly control our moods and minds at large. Positive & uplifting content and interactions create a psychological environment for our mental well being.


Reddit, one of the largest social platforms, is a hive of good as well as bad content. With growing toxicity on the Internet and these difficult times, it is quite easy to spiral downwards questioning your own existence.


How about filtering the unwanted communities from [r/Popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/popular) and only experiencing good vibes?


With Hazmat, you can now block all the unwanted sub Reddits from the front page and focus on what you desire the most. Just add a sub to the list and never see it again. Give it a try and do let us know how your Reddit experience was influenced.


P.S.: To understand how digital consumption affects us, watch [The Social Dilemma](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Fin%2Ftitle%2F81254224&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHT6d88NsPBBegEKGz44Bblwxpc_A).
