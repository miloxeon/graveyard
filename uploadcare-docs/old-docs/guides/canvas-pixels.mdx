It is a great idea to use images from our CDN on HTML canvas.
Unfortunately browsers restrict access to canvas if an image was downloaded
from untrusted source. By default only images from the same origin
are treated as trusted. If you’ll draw the image from other origins,
the canvas will be marked as “dirty” and no pixel read will be possible
from the canvas.

Calling `getImageData()` or `toDataURL()` will lead to `SecurityError`:

```js
canvas.toDataURL();
// Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'toDataURL' on 'HTMLCanvasElement': Tainted canvases may not be exported.
canvas.getContext('2d').getImageData(0, 0, 100, 100);
// Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'getImageData' on 'CanvasRenderingContext2D': The canvas has been tainted by cross-origin data.
```

One of solutions is using `crossOrigin` image property
to ask browser to request the image in a safe way.

Unfortunately this property is available only in Chrome and Firefox.
But it is very easy to make such request manually with the help of
`XMLHttpRequest`.

This works well in Chrome 19+, Firefox 6+, IE 10+, Safari 6+ and Opera 15+.
