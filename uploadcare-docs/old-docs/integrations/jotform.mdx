# Serverless File Uploads for JotForm

[JotForm][ext-jotform-my-forms] is an easy-to-use online form builder bundled with
lots of convenient integrations. The Uploadcare [integration][ext-jotform-uploader]
adds the features of our [File Uploader][feature-file-uploader] to any form:
serverless file uploads and in-browser image editing. We are proud our File
Uploader is top-rated by the JotForm community 👏

The File Uploader is a highly customizable file uploader that adapts to your flows and
layouts.

By the way, every file uploaded via Uploadcare gets instantly cached on our CDN
and swiftly and reliably delivered across 130+ countries.

In this guide, we are going to create a form that collects speaker candidate
data before some conference. We will use a combination of JotForm fields and two
file uploaders. The first one deals with uploading a candidate photo and making some
edits, and the second one will be up to collecting slides for a presentation.

It should take you about _17 minutes_ to build a form like that using our
File Uploader integration.

Here is a preview of what we are going to build,

## Step 1. Create Uploadcare Account
{id="make-uc-account"}

Feel free to skip the step if you’ve already got an Uploadcare account.
Otherwise, here’s how you make one:

* Go to our [Sign Up][account-signup] page
* Provide your email and choose a password
* Confirm your email by clicking the validation link in your inbox

## Step 2. Get a Public API Key
{id="get-key"}

You will need to define a Public API Key in the File Uploader settings to set
a project your files will go to. So, navigate to your [dashboard][dashboard]
and create a new [project][settings-projects] or discover a
[Public API Key][settings-keys] for an existing one.

## Step 3. Create a Form and Add the Uploader
{id="make-form"}

The step is about creating a form. If you aren’t registered with JotForm, please
look through the [FAQ][ext-jotform-faq] and sign up on the JotForm’s
[main page][ext-jotform-start-page].

### Creating a form
{id="creating-form"}

Once you’re in JotForm, navigate to the [my forms][ext-jotform-my-forms] tab.

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/3e3ce5e0-1de1-44f5-b014-e656843b9839/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-2-my-forms.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/3e3ce5e0-1de1-44f5-b014-e656843b9839/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-2-my-forms@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="JotForm My Forms tab" />

The tab holds all the forms you’ve ever created with JotForm. You can see our
form is there and named “Become a speaker.” Let’s see what’s inside by checking
a box to the left of the form title. Hit “Edit Form,” and you are in.

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/46334de9-ff87-4804-81ce-788313b018ee/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-3-editing-form.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/46334de9-ff87-4804-81ce-788313b018ee/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-3-editing-form@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="Form edit state" />

As you can see, there are two buttons for uploading files: one is called
“Choose an image” and another “Upload images.” Here’s how you add those.

### Adding the uploader
{id="adding-uploader"}

Click “Add form element.” Navigate to “Widgets” and type in “File Uploader” to
run a quick search for our integration,

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/f38deb96-e92a-4d0d-b68b-dab6dc46f146/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-4-adding-widgets.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/f38deb96-e92a-4d0d-b68b-dab6dc46f146/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-4-adding-widgets@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="Adding a file uploader" />

Here it is, hit the yellow logo, and our file uploader gets added to your form.
It is added with default settings and needs some configuration.

## Step 4. Configure the File Uploader
{id="configure-widget"}

The first thing here is setting the label for your new file uploader. It is done by
clicking the gear icon to the right and navigating to the “Advanced” tab. Modify
the field called “Question text.” Your file uploader label will change,

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/ca0956ab-5aae-4117-a16e-955a646b1a53/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-5-advanced-settings.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/ca0956ab-5aae-4117-a16e-955a646b1a53/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-5-advanced-settings@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="Changing file uploader label" />

Now, let us get more advanced and click the magic wand icon to the right. That
opens the file uploader settings, let’s dig in.

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/5f28952e-795b-4ef4-88be-eb0fdbf245db/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-6-widget-settings.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/5f28952e-795b-4ef4-88be-eb0fdbf245db/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-6-widget-settings@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="Widget settings" />

First of, let’s paste your Public API Key into the respective field. We are
using `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` as a placeholder.

We are going to configure the file uploader to get speaker candidate photos. We just
need a single photo, so we can set “Multiple” to “No.” We want to show a preview
of an uploaded image, “Preview step” to “Yes.” It is also important to ensure
uploaded files are images, “Images only” to “Yes,”

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/19a69868-3700-49b9-9985-c7a0eb0a02f5/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-7-more-settings.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/19a69868-3700-49b9-9985-c7a0eb0a02f5/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-7-more-settings@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="More file uploader settings" />

We also want to allow form users to edit their photos on upload. Let’s use
[“Effects Tab”][feature-fxtab] for it. When switched to “Yes,” this setting
allows you to choose which effects can be applied on image upload,

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/f9529406-fa73-4883-9f89-5103066378fc/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-8-allowed-effects.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/f9529406-fa73-4883-9f89-5103066378fc/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-8-allowed-effects@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="Effects Tab" />

By default, the plugin removes the original trailing filename from the URL.
`add filenames` provides the opposite behavior and leaves your filename in place.

This could be useful when passing URLs to a third-party system for further
processing, for instance.

<p>
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/aee0e096-e830-46db-b93a-158b8baf886e/-/preview/-/resize/340x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/jotform-widget-add-filenames.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/aee0e096-e830-46db-b93a-158b8baf886e/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/jotform-widget-add-filenames@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="Add filenames option" />
</p>

You can also add a set of [Image Transformations][feature-image-processing]
to a CDN URL automatically. `custom string` would be the field holding a string
to further append to your CDN URLs.

<p>
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/f3d2d357-9065-4515-abeb-8a519592e3fe/-/preview/-/resize/340x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/jotform-widget-add-custom-string.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/f3d2d357-9065-4515-abeb-8a519592e3fe/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/jotform-widget-add-custom-string@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="Add custom string" />
</p>

Last but not least, you might want to change the button caption. That is done by
modifying “Additional global settings.” We added a simple example of what you
can do with those. See the complete list of file uploader settings at the
[File Uploader Options][file-uploader-options] docs page.

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/f28f31f6-4412-4aa8-82f3-56f71cc75edd/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-9-globals.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/f28f31f6-4412-4aa8-82f3-56f71cc75edd/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-9-globals@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="Additional global settings" />

Now, add another file uploader and configure it to accept multi uploads of image-only
files. Play with changing its label and button caption. It will allow form
users to upload slides for their presentation. In fact, you might want to create
a separate Uploadcare project (and specify another Public API Key for the second
file uploader) to get those slides: this helps organize content in your account.

Now, once we are ready to roll, let’s publish the form and test how it performs.

## Step 5. Publish the Form and Test It
{id="publish"}

Publishing a form is as easy as hitting “Publish.” That will provide you with
a direct link to your form. We can then send that link to our candidates,

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/a3383a8c-ac36-4478-b6e5-a8c6853f1364/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-10-publish.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/a3383a8c-ac36-4478-b6e5-a8c6853f1364/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-10-publish@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="Publishing a form" />

To test the form, click “Open in new tab.” That shows how your users will see
the form. Fill in some fields and upload a photo or two,

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/97627500-17f8-4b23-8c1f-bc78f4605335/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-11-test.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/97627500-17f8-4b23-8c1f-bc78f4605335/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-11-test@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="Testing a form" />

Get back to “My Forms” and click the sheet icon to the left of your form title.
This will open a list of your form submissions. You can navigate through those
by clicking arrows in the top-right.

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/a6f1cef1-81e4-4ca5-9581-5049e578c52c/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-12-iterate.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/a6f1cef1-81e4-4ca5-9581-5049e578c52c/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/pic-12-iterate@2x.jpg 2x"
    alt="Check out form submissions" />

Note, files uploaded by form users become either a single URL for an avatar
photo or a list of those for slides. Those are your file permalinks. You do not
need to have any storage for uploaded files: just put those links in your
database. Check out [this article][delivery-cdn-operations] to learn more about
how those URLs are made and what they mean.

That’s it. We have just powered a form with serverless file uploads in 5 simple
steps ✨
