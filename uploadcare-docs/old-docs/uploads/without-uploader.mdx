# Uploading files without File Uploader

## Upload API

You don't have to use our File Uploader to upload your files. You can upload them directly with our Upload API, and build your own solution on top of it.

Upload API gives you:
* Direct Uploads
* Multipart Uploads
* Uploading from URL
* Secure Uploading

Check out [Upload API Reference][api-reference-upload] for detailed information.

## Upload API clients

Keep in mind that every Uploadcare API client provides some method of uploading files. So, if you’re not writing a library, you are likely better off using one of our
[API clients][integrations-clients] for a language you prefer.

There is a powerful [JS upload client][ext-uploadcare-upload-client] that works both in the browser and on the backend.
