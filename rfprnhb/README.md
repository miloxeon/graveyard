Remove annoyances from russian pornhub. When you visit pornhub in russia, there'll be an annoying verification screen that prevents you from using pornhub without a VK verification. So this extension removes that screen.

## Usage

Press "Clone or download", then choose "Download ZIP". Unpack this and remember where you've unpacked.

### Chrome

1. Menu -> More Tools -> Extensions
2. Developer mode
3. Load unpacked
4. Choose the path you'd unpacked the extension to

### Firefox 
1. Go to `about:debugging#addons`, just paste this to search bar and press enter
2. Load Temorary add-on...
3. Choose the path you'd unpacked the extension to

## Why
It works much faster than any VPN.

Enjoy.
