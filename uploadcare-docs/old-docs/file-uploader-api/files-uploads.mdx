# JavaScript API — Uploading Files

<Messages>

</Messages>

Uploadcare File Uploader and JavaScript API work with file instances, which implement
the [jQuery promise interface][ext-jquery-promise-interface]. You can create a
file instance via a new upload or by addressing existing files.

* [Creating a new file instance](#file-new-instance)
  * [File instance from URL](#file-from-url)
  * [File instance from native object](#file-from-native)
  * [File instance from DOM](#file-from-dom)
  * [File instance from UUID or CDN URL](#file-from-cdn)
* [Wait until a file is available](#file-wait-when-ready)
* [Checking the progress of a file upload](#file-uploading-progress)
* [Cancelling a file upload](#file-cancel-uploading)
* [Object overview, `fileInfo`](#file-info)
* [Object overview, `uploadInfo`](#upload-info)

## Creating a new file instance
{id="file-new-instance"}

A new file instance can be constructed by calling the `fileFrom` function. Where
the first argument is one of the predefined identifiers, and the second argument
holds a file source. Depending on the passed identifier, the function can start
a new upload or return an instance of an existing file.

Note, you can also pass a `settings` [object][file-uploader-config-object] to
`fileFrom` as its third parameter.

### File instance from URL
{id="file-from-url"}

Uploading a file from URL is done by passing the `url` identifier to the
`fileFrom` function:

```js{noAutoLinker}
var file = uploadcare.fileFrom('url', 'http://example.com/image.png');
```

### File instance from native object
{id="file-from-native"}

Our JavaScript API supports uploading new files from
[native file objects][ext-native-file-object]. This is done by passing the
`object` identifier to the `fileFrom` function.

```js
var file = uploadcare.fileFrom('object', input.files[0]);
```

This method supports large file uploads (> 100MB) and checking upload progress.
However, it will not work in outdated browsers, see
[browser support][ext-caniuse-fileapi].

### File instance from DOM
{id="file-from-dom"}

You can also upload files from input DOM elements. This is done by passing the
`input` identifier to `fileFrom`. Uploading from such inputs works in all browsers
but does not support large files and checking upload progress.

```js
var file = uploadcare.fileFrom('input', input);
```

### File instance from UUID or CDN URL
{id="file-from-cdn"}

That is the case when a file instance is created from an existing file that has
a UUID and hence a CDN URL. Any of those can be used as a file source in
`fileFrom`. The proper identifier to pass to the function, here, is `uploaded`:

```js
var file = uploadcare.fileFrom('uploaded', '61783708-7090-4d6a-b82b-81f98e40a327');
```

## Wait until a file is available
{id="file-wait-when-ready"}

Quite often, you want to ensure a file is there and ready before getting its
instance. That is what the function is all about. It returns a
[fileInfo][api-reference-js-file-info] object.

```js
file.done(function(fileInfo) {
  // Upload has successfully completed and a file is ready.
}).fail(function(error, fileInfo) {
  // Upload failed, or something else went wrong, a file is not ready.
});
```

The `error` argument in the `fail` callback is one of the following values,
or a user-defined custom value, raised via [validators][api-reference-js-file-validation].

* `'baddata'`, invalid argument passed to file constructor
* `'size'`, file size is too large
* `'upload'`, error during upload
* `'user'`, upload was canceled
* `'info'`, error when fetching file information
* `'deleted'`, file was deleted, also applicable to groups and files within

## Checking the progress of a file upload
{id="file-uploading-progress"}

When handling larger files, there is a sense in checking their upload progress.
The `progress` function does exactly that and returns an
[uploadInfo][api-reference-js-upload-info] object.

```js
file.progress(function(uploadInfo) {
  // State of your upload gets updated.
  // The callback is invoked at least once with a current state,
  // right after assignment.
});
```

You can also show a file uploading progress via a
[jQuery UI progressbar][ext-jquery-ui-progressbar].

```js
file.progress(function(uploadInfo) {
  $('#progress').progressbar('value', uploadInfo.progress);
});
```

## Cancelling a file upload
{id="file-cancel-uploading"}

Just use `cancel` in case you want to immediately stop any in-progress upload and
all the events.

```js
file.cancel();
```
