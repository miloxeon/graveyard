# JS Upload Client

Upload Client handles uploading operations by wrapping Uploadcare
[Upload API][api-reference-upload]. You can use it from withing your Node.js
app and in a browser.

[GitHub &rarr;][ext-uploadcare-upload-client]

## Features

Upload features:
* Upload files from local storage and URLs (up to 5 TB)
* Multipart uploading for large files
* Track uploading progress
* Bulk file uploading
* Uploading network to speed uploading jobs (like CDN)

Security features:
* Secure authentication
* Secure uploads (signed uploads)

## Install

```bash
npm install @uploadcare/upload-client
```

## Integration

To access the High-Level API, you need to create an instance of `UploadClient`
providing the necessary settings. Specifying `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` is mandatory: it
points to the specific Uploadcare project:

```javascript
import UploadClient from '@uploadcare/upload-client'

const client = new UploadClient({ publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY' })
```

## Usage example

Once the UploadClient instance is created, you can start using the wrapper to
upload files from binary data:

```javascript
client
  .uploadFile(fileData)
  .then(file => console.log(file.uuid))
```

Another option is uploading files from URL, via the `uploadFile` method:

```javascript
const fileURL = 'https://example.com/file.jpg'

client
  .uploadFile(fileURL)
  .then(file => console.log(file.uuid))
```

You can also use the `uploadFile` method to get previously uploaded files via
their UUIDs:

```javascript
const fileUUID = 'edfdf045-34c0-4087-bbdd-e3834921f890'

client
  .uploadFile(fileUUID)
  .then(file => console.log(file.uuid))
```

You can track uploading progress:

```javascript
const fileUUID = 'edfdf045-34c0-4087-bbdd-e3834921f890'
const onProgress = ({ value }) => {
  console.log(value)
}

client
  .uploadFile(fileUUID, { onProgress })
  .then(file => console.log(file.uuid))
```

You can cancel file uploading and track this event:

```javascript
const fileUUID = 'edfdf045-34c0-4087-bbdd-e3834921f890'
const controller = new CancelController()

client
  .uploadFile(fileUUID, { cancel: controller })
  .then(file => console.log(file.uuid))
  .catch(error => {
    if (error.isCancel) {
      console.log(`File uploading was canceled.`)
    }
  })

// Cancel uploading
controller.cancel()
```

## Testing

```
npm run test
```

By default, tests will run with a mock server. You can run tests within
production environment too.

Run test on production servers: 

```bash
npm run test:production
```

Run test with a mock server (mock server starts automaticaly):

```bash
npm run test
```

Run a mock server:

```
npm run mock:start
```

And then you can run your test:

```
npm run test:jest
```
