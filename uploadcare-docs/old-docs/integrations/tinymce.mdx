# Serverless File Uploads for TinyMCE

[TinyMCE][ext-tinymce-home] is a powerful WYSIWYG editor powering 100M sites on
the web. Integrating [Uploadcare][home] enables serverless file and image
upload via [File Uploader][file-uploader] that adapts to your appâ€™s
flow and design.

Every file uploaded via File Uploader gets instantly cached on our CDN and
swiftly and reliably delivered across 130+ countries.

This guide covers integrating File Uploader into TinyMCE 4+ in _6 minutes_.
Hereâ€™s a basic [demo][mce-github-demo] of what youâ€™ll get.

* [Step 1. Get Uploadcare Account](#get-uc-account)
* [Step 2. Prepare Your TinyMCE Installation](#prepare-tinymce)
* [Step 3. Add File Uploader](#add-uploader)
* [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## Step 1. Get Uploadcare Account
{id="get-uc-account"}

First, you will need an Uploadcare account. In case you donâ€™t have it,
[Sign Up][account-signup] for one, itâ€™s free. Then, navigate to your
[dashboard][dashboard] to create a new [project][settings-projects] or obtain
[Public API Key][settings-keys-public] for an existing one.

If youâ€™re going to allow non-image uploads in your TinyMCE, add
[billing info][account-billing] in your account settings.

## Step 2. Prepare Your TinyMCE Installation
{id="prepare-tinymce"}

The second step is about installing TinyMCE. Itâ€™s quick: update your page with
the following elements:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script src='https://cloud.tinymce.com/stable/tinymce.min.js'></script>
  <script>
  tinymce.init({
    selector: '#mytextarea'
  });
  </script>
</head>

<body>
<h1>TinyMCE Quick Start Guide</h1>
  <form method="post">
    <textarea id="mytextarea">Hello, World!</textarea>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

[Tiny Quick Start][ext-tinymce-quickstart].

## Step 3. Add File Uploader
{id="add-uploader"}

Now that weâ€™ve got TinyMCE letâ€™s integrate Uploadcare. The HTML snippet above
can serve as a good starting point.

Download the latest plugin archive from the [Releases][mce-github-releases]
page of our repo. Extract the downloaded archive to the plugin directory of your
TinyMCE installation or any other target location.

And the last thing is to update settings applied on TinyMCE init:

```html
tinymce.init({
    selector: '#mytextarea',
    plugins: 'uploadcare',
    toolbar: 'uploadcare',
    external_plugins: {
      uploadcare: '/path/to/uploadcare/plugin.js',
    },
    uploadcare_public_key: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
});
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` in the above snippet with the Public API
Key you discovered in the [first step](#get-uc-account) of this guide. Check if
`external_plugins` is a valid path for your TinyMCE installation.

Save your page and open it in your browser. The file uploader is there and ready to
receive uploads.
