# Meteor File Uploader

Receive files from your users with a clean, lightweight and easy-to-integrate
widget. This Meteor integration helps you integrate
[Uploadcare Widget][feature-file-uploader] into your Meteor app natively.

[GitHub &rarr;][meteor-github]

## Features

* Upload files from a local disk, camera, and cloud source (up to 5 TB)
* Multipart uploading for large files
* Bulk file uploading
* In-browser image editing
* Uploading network to speed uploading jobs (like CDN)

## Installation

`meteor add uploadcare:uploadcare-widget`

## Usage
### Public key

Discover your Uploadcare
[public key](https://uploadcare.com/documentation/keys/)
and use
[Meteor application settings](https://guide.meteor.com/deployment.html#environment)
to set the key for Meteor.

Add `uploadcare` to your settings under a `public` key, this will make
Uploadcare settings available for your Meteor client.

For example, `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "public": {
    "uploadcare": {
      "publicKey": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

Run Meteor application with `settings.json` as settings file:

```
meteor --settings settings.json
```

### HTML element

Place the following `input` element somewhere into your templates.

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" name="my_file" />
```

This `input` HTML tag will define where the widget will be positioned on a page.
Don't forget about the `name` attribute to further fine-tune your elements
behavior.

The library looks for inputs with the `role` attribute, and places widgets
there. As soon as a file gets uploaded, this `input` receives a CDN link with
file UUID.
