# Rust API Client

Rust integration handles uploads and file operations by wrapping Uploadcare
[Upload API][api-reference-upload] and [REST API][api-reference-rest]. This
comprehensive API client lets you use most of the Uploadcare features from within
your Rust app.

[GitHub &rarr;][rust-github]

## Features

Upload features:
* Upload files from local storage and URLs (up to 5 TB)
* Multipart uploading for large files
* Uploading network to speed uploading jobs (like CDN)

File management features:
* Get file info and perform various operations (store/delete/copy) with them
* Work with groups of files 
* Get info about account project
* Manage webhooks
* Convert documents
* Encode and transform videos

Security features:
* Secure authentication
* Secure uploads (signed uploads)
* Secure delivery (authenticated URLs)

## Requirements

- rustc 1.43   
- cargo 1.43

## Installation

Install uploadcare-go with:

```toml
[dependencies]
uploadcare = "^0.1"
```

## Configuration 

By default the `full` is enabled (REST and Upload API).

To reduce the code size, disable default features and enable just the APIs you use:

```toml
# Example: REST API only
uploadcare = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["rest"] }
```

Creating a client:

```rust
use ucare;
use ucare::file;
use ucare::upload;

let creds = ucare::apicreds {
    secret_key: "your_project_secret_key",
    pub_key: "your_project_pub_key",
};

// creating rest client
let config = ucare::RestConfig {
    sign_based_auth: true,
    api_version: ucare::RestApiVersion::v06,
};
let rest_client = ucare::RestClient::new(config, creds).unwrap();

// creating upload client
let config = ucare::UploadConfig {
    sign_based_upload: true,
};
let upload_client = ucare::UploadClient::new(config, creds).unwrap();
```

## Usage example

For a comprehensive list of examples, check out the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/uploadcare/).
Below are a few usage examples:

```rust
let file_svc = file::new_svc(&rest_client);

let file_id = "b7c1bf20-0f4c-4ba4-b3a8-a74ebc663752";
let file_info = file_svc.info(file_id).unwrap();
println!("{}: {:?}", file_id, file_info);

let upload_svc = upload::new_svc(&upload_client);

let params = upload::FileParams {
    path: "/path/to/file".to_string(),
    name: "filename".to_string(),
    to_store: Some(upload::ToStore::Auto),
};
let file = upload_svc.file(params).unwrap();
println!("uploaded: {:?}", file.id);

```
