# JavaScript API â€” Controlling Drag and Drop

Uploadcare File Uploader supports Drag and Drop that you can control via JavaScript API.

* [Checking browser support](#browser-support)
* [Uploading files by dropping](#upload-drop)
* [Getting raw data by dropping](#receive-drop)

## Checking a browser support
{id="browser-support"}

We use a boolean parameter that is set to `true` if a browser supports Drag and
Drop and file API.

```js
var browser_supports_dragdrop = uploadcare.dragdrop.support;
```

## Uploading files by dropping
{id="upload-drop"}

You can get file objects after dropping them on the `el` element, where `el` can
be a DOM element, selector or jQuery object.

```js
uploadcare.dragdrop.uploadDrop(el, callback[, settings]);
```

For instance, that is the way to upload a single file. If multiple files are
selected, only the first one of them gets uploaded:

```js
uploadcare.dragdrop.uploadDrop(el, function(file) {
  file.done(...);
});
```

You can also upload multiple files at once. Here is how:

```js
uploadcare.dragdrop.uploadDrop(el, function(files) {
  files; // array
}, {multiple: true});
```

`settings` here is a [settings object][file-uploader-options].

## Getting raw data by dropping
{id="receive-drop"}

Our JavaScript API allows you to get raw data after dropping files on the `el`
element, which can either be a DOM element, selector or jQuery object.

```js
uploadcare.dragdrop.receiveDrop(el, callback);
```

For example:

```js
uploadcare.dragdrop.receiveDrop(el, function(type, data) {
  type; // 'object' or 'url'
  data; // Array of native File objecs or URLs.

  // Retrieving files, or just the first one if there are many.
  var file = uploadcare.fileFrom(type, data[0]);

  // Retrieving multiple files in one go
  var fileArray = uploadcare.filesFrom(type, data);
});
```
