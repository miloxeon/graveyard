# How to Enable Uploading UGC to Wix: PDFs, Images, Video, and More

[Wix][ext-wix-home] is a free website builder. With Uploadcare, you can allow
your users to submit media via forms, with no fuss about storage or uploading
interface.

_In just 5 minutes_ we will **build** a working uploads-enabled form via
[Uploadcare File Uploader][feature-file-uploader] using just a few lines of
code.

## How Uploadcare Uploads Files to Wix
{id="how-uc-uploads"}

Our responsive and mobile-ready File Uploader provided as a standard
JavaScript library. Technically, File Uploader replaces your basic
`<input type="file">` controls, which then become buttons that activate the file
uploader dialog. Every piece of content uploaded via Uploadcare gets instantly
cached on our CDN and swiftly and reliably delivered across 130+ countries.

What does it look like for an end user? For example, let‚Äôs say you need your
users to upload scans of their documents. With File Uploader integrated, they
see a submission form where they can easily add PDF files to your Wix website.

But of course, it‚Äôs not only about PDFs. Images and video files that are stored
in various sources, from local folders on your PC to social media, can also be
uploaded to Wix.

So, let‚Äôs get started.

- [Step 2. Create an HTML Block](#add-html-block)
- [Step 3. Add File Uploader](#add-file-uploader)
- [Step 4. Publish Your Upload Form to Wix](#results)
- [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## Step 1. Setup
{id="setup"}

Before we begin, let‚Äôs make sure everything is in place.

First of all, you need a Wix-powered website. If you don‚Äôt have one, it will
only take you a few clicks to [create one][ext-wix-home].

Second, you need to have an Uploadcare account. If you don‚Äôt, [Sign
Up][account-signup] for one. Once you‚Äôve created it, navigate to your
[dashboard][account] to create a new [project][settings-projects] or discover
your [Public API key][settings-keys] for an existing one.

By the way, if you plan to let users submit non-image files via your form, add
[billing info][community-billing-info] to your account.

Now that you‚Äôre set up, go to your Wix website and proceed to the next step.

## Step 2. Create an HTML Block
{id="add-html-block"}

Go to the Wix editor and open your website. Use the toolbox on the left side to
place an HTML element on your page: hit the **plus sign,** then click **More,**
and choose **HTML iframe in the Embeds** section.

  desc='Adding upload HTML to Wix'
/>

Now, place the element in your working area. Make sure the block width is at
least 760px to ensure that File Uploader will display correctly.

## Step 3. Add the Uploadcare File Uploader
{id="add-file-uploader"}

Select the block you have just placed and click the **Enter Code** button. A
settings box will appear, providing you with two options: a ‚ÄúCode‚Äù radio button
and an HTML code box. Copy the code below and paste it there.

Don‚Äôt forget to replace YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY with the real Public API Key you got
after signing up for Uploadcare.

```html
<script>
  UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
</script>
<script
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/3.x/uploadcare.full.min.js"
  data-integration="Wix"
></script>

<fieldset>
  <legend>Submit Your Question</legend>
  <form>
    <p>
      <label for="email">E-mail</label>
      <input type="email" id="email" name="email" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <label for="question">Your question</label>
      <textarea id="question" name="question"></textarea>
    </p>
    <p>
      <label for="images">Your files</label>
      <input
        type="hidden"
        id="files"
        name="files"
        role="uploadcare-uploader"
        data-clearable
        data-images-only
        data-crop="free,2:3,4:3,16:9"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </p>
  </form>
</fieldset>
```

<Image

  desc='HTML code for Wix upload'
/>

The `data-images-only` [option][file-uploader-option-images-only] sits in the
file uploader config to provide a fail-safe experience when working with
accounts on the Free plan with no billing info added: those only allow image
uploads.

## Step 4. Publish Your Upload Form to Wix
{id="results"}

Click **Update,** and you‚Äôre done integrating the file uploader.

  desc=' The final look of a file uploader for Wix'
/>

You can rearrange the order of blocks in the Wix editor by moving them a layer
up or down. Ensure your form is in the topmost layer (Ctrl + Shift + ‚Üí will do
that), so no other elements are blocking the view when the dialog is activated.

Note that Wix puts external HTML in an `<iframe>` element, which is not
guaranteed to be responsive across devices. Test the created form to make sure
it displays properly on your users‚Äô most popular devices.

## Conclusion

automatically optimized to provide the best page load speed, fit any screen, and
