# How to Transfer Your Files to Uploadcare

If you came to Uploadcare from a DIY solution or another platform, the first
thing to migrate is to copy files from their current place to your Uploadcare
storage, so that they’re handled and delivered with an Uploadcare CDN.

A Migro tool ([GitHub][migro-github]) will help you do that.

**Step 1**. Create a text file with a list of files you’d like to transfer to Uploadcare:

```{noAutoLinker}
https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/YBLVVdUpRqC4nOynxDd8
https://www.facebook.com/rsrc.php/v3/y7/r/dTQOHZm7Z-3.svg
uNWvPRXJQmO49MJbPZn9
```

**Step 2**. Feed it to Migro, and the result will show you a transfer status and a new path with a UUID at Uploadcare for each file:

```{noAutoLinker}
https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/YBLVVdUpRqC4nOynxDd8       success     https://ucarecdn.com/d8f8de4b-f92e-41a0-b7f9-28fd4baad9ae/
https://www.facebook.com/rsrc.php/v3/y7/r/dTQOHZm7Z-3.svg   success     https://ucarecdn.com/4a03f3d4-2bd3-456e-89a5-008190980248/
https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/uNWvPRXJQmO49MJbPZn9       fail        Uploading of these files types is not allowed on your current plan.
```

**Step 3**. After that, replace the old links with the new ones for files that were successfully copied.
