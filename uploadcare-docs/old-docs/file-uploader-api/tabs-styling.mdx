# JavaScript API â€” File Uploader Styling

You can easily adapt our file uploader or dialog to your page style by modifying the
respective [CSS stylesheet][file-uploader-styling]. However, some tabs are
opened in an `iframe` from our domain, e.g., Facebook tab, Instagram, etc.
For those tabs you can customize, please use the following methods.

## Adding plain CSS
{id="add-plain-css"}

You can add some plain CSS code to tabs. Use classes to identify a tab you want
to modify.

```js
var style = ".source-facebook .main-content {background: #98AFD5;}";
uploadcare.tabsCss.addStyle(style);
```

## Adding CSS file
{id="add-css-file"}

Another option is adding a CSS file to your tabs via an absolute file URL.

```js{noAutoLinker}
uploadcare.tabsCss.addUrl("https://site.com/styles/uc.tabs.css");
```

Note, tabs are opened via HTTPS. Hence there is no way to add a CSS file through
HTTP. If your site does not support HTTPS, you can use a third-party hosting
providing HTTPS support for such files. Amazon S3 is a good option.
