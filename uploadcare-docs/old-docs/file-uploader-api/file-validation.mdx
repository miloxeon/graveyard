# JavaScript API — File Validation

  <Migration />
</Messages>

Validators allow restricting user choice to certain kinds of files. For example,
you may want to only accept files less than 2MB in size or just PDF documents.
With our API, a validator is a function that receives a `fileInfo` object for
every uploaded file and throws an exception if that file does not meet your set
requirements.

```js
function imagesOnly(fileInfo) {
  if (fileInfo.isImage === false) {
    throw new Error('image');
  }
}
```

Validators can be called once the info on file becomes available. All unknown
fields used for validation have `null` values when a validator is called. This
means a single validator can be called several times for a single file, each
time testing if the required field is not `null`.

```js
function maxDimensions(width, height) {
  return function(fileInfo) {
    var imageInfo = fileInfo.originalImageInfo;
    if (imageInfo !== null) {
      if (imageInfo.width > width || imageInfo.height > height) {
        throw new Error('dimensions');
      }
    }
  };
}
```

## Validation inside File Uploader
{id="widget-based"}

Validators can also be added to the file uploader through its `validators` property.
This works for both single-file and multi-file file uploaders.

```js
var widget = uploadcare.Widget('#uploadcare-file');
widget.validators.push(imagesOnly);
```

`widget.validators` is a regular javascript array. One file uploader can be assigned
several validators, and one validator can be assigned several file uploaders.

```js
firstWidget.validators.push(imagesOnly);
secondWidget.validators.push(imagesOnly);
firstWidget.validators.push(maxSize(1024 * 1024));
firstWidget.validators.push(maxDimensions(800, 600));
firstWidget.validators; // [function imagesOnly(){...}, function () {...}, function () {...}]
```

Note, you can’t rewrite validators with another object, you need to remove them
from an original array.

```js
// Leave only first two validators:
widget.validators = widget.validators.splice(0, 2); // WRONG!
widget.validators.splice(2);  // Correct.

// Remove all validators:
widget.validators = [];       // WRONG!
widget.validators.length = 0; // Correct.
```

## Validation in JS API
{id="js-based"}

You can add a `validators` array to a Settings object of any API function where
it makes sense:

```js
uploadcare.openDialog(null, {
  validators: [
    imagesOnly,
    maxSize(1024 * 1024),
    minDimensions(800, 600)
  ]
});
```

The list of such functions includes but is not limited to: `openDialog`,
`openPanel`, `fileFrom`, `filesFrom`, `dragdrop.uploadDrop`, `dragdrop.receiveDrop`.

It is better to use validators instead of checking file properties in
`widget.onChange` and `widget.onUploadComplete` callbacks. Validators are
activated before a dialog gets closed thus improving your UX.

## Error messages
{id="error-messages"}

Each argument in the `Error` constructor is a key in your locale file. Such keys
are mapped to messages shown to your users. The keys and messages can either be
[predefined][file-uploader-locale-github-preset] like `size`, `image`, or
[custom][file-uploader-locale-custom].
