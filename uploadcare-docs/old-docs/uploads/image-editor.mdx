# Image editor

Editing images right in a browser is the closest path for your app to receive
better images. And those, in turn, provide higher engagement rates and
conversions. The quality of visuals becomes an even greater concern when you
want to perfect images sent by your users before they get to your site or app.

Uploadcare features a [custom tab][file-uploader-custom-tabs] for the
[File Uploader][file-uploader] that allows enhancing and editing
images in any browser, mobile included. The tab is called
[Effects Tab][feature-fxtab].

There are nine on-the-fly effects you can apply right in the file uploader UI:
crop, rotate, enhance, sharpen, blur, mirror, flip, grayscale, and invert.

You can configure which effects are enabled and change the tab behavior in other
ways.

## How it works
{id="info"}

Image operations available for applying in the file uploader dialog are based on our
[Image Processing][transformations-image] feature. Effects Tab outputs a CDN URL
holding image [UUIDs][concepts-uploads] and operations applied by a user
while editing in form of URL directives. You can learn more about our Image
Processing and available operations [here][transformations-image].

Technically, every image first gets to your Uploadcare
[project][settings-projects]. Then we show an image preview in the file uploader
dialog via a CDN URL provided on file upload. When a user applies image
processing operations, we inject the corresponding URL directives. Once the
editing is complete, Effect Tab outputs the new CDN URL which includes all the
applied operations.

For example, if a user chose to apply `grayscale` and clicked `rotate` once,
here is what we will get in the output:

```cdn{noAutoLinker}
https://ucarecdn.com/:UUID/-/preview/-/grayscale/-/rotate/270/
```

Note, the `preview` operation will appear in the output URL by default due to
the Image Processing [limitations][transformations-image-limits].

## Requirements
{id="requirements"}

In-browser image editing is carried out via a
[custom file uploader tab][file-uploader-custom-tabs] called [Effects Tab][feature-fxtab].

The only requirement is [integrating Uploadcare File Uploader][file-uploader-install] before
using Effects Tab.

## Install
{id="install"}

Choose from the install methods listed below.

### NPM

Get Effects Tab:

```
npm i uploadcare-widget-tab-effects --save
```

Import the tab it in your module:

```javascript
import uploadcareTabEffects from 'uploadcare-widget-tab-effects'
```

### CDN

You can either install the minified Effects Tab version:

```html
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget-tab-effects/1.x/uploadcare.tab-effects.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

Or go with a bundled version without minification:

```html
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget-tab-effects/1.x/uploadcare.tab-effects.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

#### Usage
{id="usage"}

Start using Effects Tab by adding it to your file uploader:

```javascript
uploadcare.registerTab('preview', uploadcareTabEffects)
```

## Configuration
{id="config"}

There are multiple ways to configure the set of effects enabled in Effects Tab.

### Global Variables

You can either go with a string holding coma-separated effect names:

```html
<script>
  UPLOADCARE_EFFECTS = 'blur,sharp,grayscale'
</script>
```

or use another approach:

```html
<script>
  UPLOADCARE_EFFECTS = ['blur', 'sharp', 'grayscale']
</script>
```

### Local Attributes

The set of enabled effects for a specific file uploader instance can be controlled
via the `data-effects` attribute.

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" name="content"
  data-effects="blur,sharp,grayscale"
/>
```

### Settings Object

Following the file uploader concept, the allowed effects can be provided as the
`settings` [object][file-uploader-config-object].

```javascript
uploadcare.start({
  effects: 'blur,sharp,grayscale',
})
```

or

```javascript
uploadcare.start({
  effects: ['blur', 'sharp', 'grayscale'],
})
```

## Options
{id="options"}

### Effects `string|array`

Global: `UPLOADCARE_EFFECTS` <br/>
Local: `data-effects` <br/>
Object key: `effects` <br/>

Default value: `crop,rotate,enhance,sharp,grayscale`.

This allows you to configure the set of enabled effects. It also controls
**the order of effects** in the tab: however, `crop` will always placed first in
the set.

`effects` can either be a string holding one or more comma-separated effects or
an array of strings, JS only. You can also **enable all effects**
by setting the option to `all`.

Available effects:

* `crop`, crops images freely or using set aspect ratios
* `rotate`, rotates images
* `mirror`, provides image-mirroring capabilities
* `flip`, allows flipping images
* `blur`, filters images via Gaussian Blur
* `sharp`, allows adjusting image sharpness
* `enhance`, makes images look better via auto levels, auto contrast, and
  saturation sharpening
* `grayscale`, desaturates images
* `invert`, inverts image colors

## Localization
{id="locale"}

You can choose one of the existing [tab locales][fxtab-github-locale] or
contribute a new one. This can be done by forking the
[main repository][fxtab-github-repo] followed by adding a new localization file
to the [list][fxtab-github-locale].
