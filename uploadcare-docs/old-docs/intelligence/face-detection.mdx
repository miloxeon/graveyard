# Face Detection

With Uploadcare Image Transformations, you can detect faces in your images for
automatic cropping or blurring those out. Face Detection is implemented
in line with our general Image Transformations
[workflow][transformations-image], as the `detect_faces` URL directive.

`cdn›/:uuid/detect_faces/`

Note, `detect_faces` is not divided from a file UUID by the `/-/` separator.
Hence, it can not be piped other operations.

`detect_faces` returns coordinates of faces found in an input image. The output
is similar to the [`json`][delivery-file-info] operation. The output is a
JSON with the additional list `faces` that holds coordinates of faces that were
detected. Data for each of the found faces are put into separate lists that look
like this:

```json
[x, y, x_size, y_size]
```

Further, lists within `faces` contain:

* `x`, `y` — coordinates of the upper-left corner of an area where a face was
  found.
* `x_size`, `y_size` — dimensions of that area.

For example, let’s run a face-check for the following image on our CDN,

<p>
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/5128ec65-9957-47b8-a6ad-4c2f172ef660/-/preview/1200x1200/darker.jpg" atl="Compound image with three faces"/>
</p>

To do so, we put `detect_faces` into the image URL separating it with
the forward slash `/` from the UUID:

```cdn
https://ucarecdn.com/5128ec65-9957-47b8-a6ad-4c2f172ef660/detect_faces/
```

You will get the following `faces` list in the response JSON:

```json
"faces": [
  [45, 142, 207, 207],
  [460, 113, 238, 238],
  [892, 43, 265, 265]
]
```

Technically, the operation detects faces using Haar Cascades. That approach
deals with machine learning processes which rely on classifiers holding cascades
of features specific to faces, eyes, etc.

`detect_faces` uses an algorithm that tends to better detect fronts of faces,
rather than facial profiles. Also, covering important face features with
different objects leads to a decline in detection accuracy.

The `detect_faces` operation is still subject to testing and recalibrating the
backend when needed. So, if you ran into any issue with the operation or simply
got questions, [make a post in our community area][community].
