## Installation
{id="install"}

You’re free to choose from the install methods listed below.

### CDN
{id="install-cdn"}

Embed our client library via `<script>` tag in the `<head>`
section of each page where you’d like to make use of Uploadcare File Uploader.
Just use this CDN link to use the file uploader version with built-in jQuery:

```html
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/2.x/uploadcare.full.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

Or, if you’re already using jQuery on your page, consider loading
the light version of our file uploader without built-in jQuery:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/2.x/uploadcare.full.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

### Other install methods
{id="install-other"}

#### NPM

```bash
npm install uploadcare-widget@2.10
```

#### ES6

```js
import uploadcare from 'uploadcare-widget';
```

#### CommonJS

```js
var uploadcare = require('uploadcare-widget');
```

#### Bower

```bash
bower install uploadcare#2.10
```

#### Meteor

```bash
meteor add uploadcare:uploadcare-widget@2.10
```

## Usage
{id="usage"}

Once you’re done with the install, there are
two simple steps to take to actually use the file uploader.

**Set your [public key](#option-public-key).**
This can also sit in the `<head>` section:

```html
<script>
  UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'demopublickey';
</script>
```

Your secret key is not required for the file uploader
(it’s quite careless for your page to include any
secret keys anyway.)

**Insert file uploader element** into your form:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" name="my_file" />
```

By default, the library looks for inputs with the specified
`role` attribute and places file uploaders there.
Once a file is uploaded, this `<input>` gets a
CDN link with a file UUID. Your server then
receives this link instead of file content.

We suggest placing the file uploader somewhere at the top of your form.
Unlike regular inputs, our file uploader starts uploading files **immediately**
after they get selected by a user, not on form submission.
That way users can fill out the rest of your form while an
upload is in progress. This can be a real time saver.

## Configuration
{id="configuration"}

Uploadcare File Uploader is highly customizable through file uploader options.
Check out the [configuration page][file-uploader-configure]
to see some of them in action.

There are two ways to set file uploader options:

* Global options are set when your page loads.
* Local — when a new file uploader is created.

Changing any options during file uploader operation won’t
affect its behavior.

### Global variables
{id="global-variables"}

Globals are specified as global JavaScript variables in a `<script>` tag, for example:

```html
<script>
  UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'demopublickey';
  UPLOADCARE_LOCALE = 'ru';
</script>
```

### Local attributes
{id="local-attributes"}

Local options are specified in the target `<input>` tag as `data-*` attributes,
for example:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader"
  data-public-key="demopublickey"
  data-images-only
/>
```

### Settings object
{id="settings-object"}

Most of file uploader options can also be set within the `settings` object,
see [JavaScript API][api-reference-javascript] docs for more info.

```js
uploadcare.openDialog(null, {
  publicKey: 'demopublickey',
  imagesOnly: true,
  crop: '300x200'
});
```

Here is a summary of **all available options**:

* [Preview step](#option-preview-step)
* [Crop](#option-crop)
* [Image shrink](#option-image-shrink)
* [Clearable](#option-clearable)
* [Tabs](#option-tabs)
* [Input accept types](#option-input-accept-types)
* [Preferred types](#option-preferred-types)
* [System dialog](#option-system-dialog)

### Public key `string`
{id="option-public-key"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY` <br/>
Local: `data-public-key` <br/>
Object key: `publicKey`

Your [public key][settings-keys].


### Multiple `boolean`
{id="option-multiple"}

Global: *N/A* <br/>
Local: `data-multiple` <br/>
Object key: `multiple` <br/>

If true, the file uploader allows selecting and uploading multiple files.
Turned off by default.


### Multiple max `integer`
{id="option-multiple-max"}

Global: *N/A* <br/>
Local: `data-multiple-max` <br/>
Object key: `multipleMax` <br/>

A maximum number of files allowed for a single upload.
The default value is 0 which stands for no limit.


### Multiple min `integer`
{id="option-multiple-min"}

Global: *N/A* <br/>
Local: `data-multiple-min` <br/>
Object key: `multipleMin` <br/>

A minimum number of files allowed per upload.
The default value is 1.
Note that setting the value to 0 bears no meaning
since a file group should contain at least one file.


### Images only `boolean`
{id="option-images-only"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_IMAGES_ONLY` <br/>
Local: `data-images-only` <br/>
Object key: `imagesOnly` <br/>

If true, only image files can be uploaded.
Turned off by default.


### Preview step `boolean`
{id="option-preview-step"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_PREVIEW_STEP` <br/>
Local: `data-preview-step` <br/>
Object key: `previewStep` <br/>

If true, a preview step will follow once files are selected
(otherwise, a file dialog closes.)
Turned off by default.


### Crop `string`
{id="option-crop"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_CROP` <br/>
Local: `data-crop` <br/>
Object key: `crop` <br/>

Manual crop options, [see below](#crop).
If an uploaded file is an image, user will be able to select crop area.
This option does not force [images only](#option-images-only), though.

Works together with the [multiple](#option-multiple) option
starting from version 2.3.0.


### Image shrink `string`
{id="option-image-shrink"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_IMAGE_SHRINK` <br/>
Local: `data-image-shrink` <br/>
Object key: `imageShrink` <br/>

Allows to reduce image size before uploading to save traffic and storage space.
See the [detailed](#image-shrink) syntax below.
This option does not force [images only](#option-images-only).


### Clearable `boolean`
{id="option-clearable"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_CLEARABLE` <br/>
Local: `data-clearable` <br/>
Object key: *N/A* <br/>

Allows user to remove uploaded files from the file uploader.
Please note that those files are not deleted from your account.


### Tabs `string`
{id="option-tabs"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_TABS` <br/>
Local: `data-tabs` <br/>
Object key: `tabs` <br/>

Space-separated ordered list of upload sources
(e.g. local files, URLs or Facebook), [see below](#tabs).


### Input accept types `string`
{id="option-input-accept-types"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_INPUT_ACCEPT_TYPES` <br/>
Local: `data-input-accept-types` <br/>
Object key: `inputAcceptTypes` <br/>

Sets the `accept` attribute for a file picking dialog.
By default, the value is `image/*` if [images only](#option-images-only)
is true or empty if not.
`null` value means `accept` always should be empty regardless of `images only`.
You can find other values in
[this specification][ext-mozilla-devspecs].
Please note that this is not a replacement for file [validation][api-reference-js-file-validation]
because users can still choose any type of file by drag&drop or from URL.


### Preferred types `string`
{id="option-preferred-types"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_PREFERRED_TYPES` <br/>
Local: `data-preferred-types` <br/>
Object key: `preferredTypes` <br/>

Defines the list of preferred MIME types.
The list should be ordered and contain space-separated
MIME types. Common parts can be marked with asterisks:
`image/* application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.*`.
If no MIME types match the criteria or preferred types aren’t set,
default formats are used.

Keep in mind that some cloud services can export data in different formats.
For example, Google document can be exported as Word document,
PDF or plain text.


### System dialog `boolean`
{id="option-system-dialog"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_SYSTEM_DIALOG` <br/>
Local: `data-system-dialog` <br/>
Object key: *N/A* <br/>

Forces native file picking dialog over the Uploadcare one.
Thus, making file uploader behavior as close as possible to the
usual `<input type="file">`. Native behavior is achieved
at the expense of support for
[social networks and cloud services](#option-tabs),
[image crop](#option-crop), and [preview](#option-preview-step).
Multiple file selection would still work, though.
The option doesn’t work in old browsers versions,
instead the dialog falls back to the Uploadcare one.


### Locale `string`
{id="option-locale"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_LOCALE` <br/>
Local: *N/A* <br/>
Object key: *N/A* <br/>

The file uploader supports <WidgetLocalesCount /> of languages.

English locale is used by default.


### Locale translations `object`
{id="option-locale-translations"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_LOCALE_TRANSLATIONS` <br/>
Local: *N/A* <br/>
Object key: *N/A* <br/>

Custom localization options, [see below](#custom-localization).


### Locale pluralize `object`
{id="option-locale-pluralize"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_LOCALE_PLURALIZE` <br/>
Local: *N/A* <br/>
Object key: *N/A* <br/>

Custom pluralization options, [see below](#pluralization).


### Secure signature `string`
{id="option-secure-signature"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_SECURE_SIGNATURE` <br/>
Local: `data-secure-signature` <br/>
Object key: `secureSignature` <br/>

In case you enable Secure Uploading for your project,
you’d need to provide the file uploader with `signature` and `expire`.
Read more about Secure Uploading in our [API docs][api-reference-signed-uploads].

The `signature` is a MD5 hex-encoded hash from a
concatenation of `secret_key` and `expire`.

Works together with the
[secure expire](#option-secure-expire) option.


### Secure expire `integer`
{id="option-secure-expire"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_SECURE_EXPIRE` <br/>
Local: `data-secure-expire` <br/>
Object key: `secureExpire` <br/>

Stands for the [Unix time][ext-wikipedia-unix-time]
to which the signature is valid, e.g. `1454902434`.

Works together with the
[secure signature option](#option-secure-signature).


### Live `boolean`
{id="option-live"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_LIVE` <br/>
Local: *N/A* <br/>
Object key: *N/A* <br/>

If true, inputs are initialized automatically, [see below](#initialization).
Enabled by default.


### Manual start `boolean`
{id="option-manual-start"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_MANUAL_START` <br/>
Local: *N/A* <br/>
Object key: *N/A* <br/>

If true, initialization of inputs is invoked manually, [see below](#initialization).
Disabled by default.


### CDN base `url`
{id="option-cdn-base"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_CDN_BASE` <br/>
Local: `data-cdn-base` <br/>
Object key: `cdnBase` <br/>

Defines schema and CDN domain. Can be changed to
[one of the predefined values][delivery-cdn]
or your custom CNAME. Defaults to `https://ucarecdn.com/`.


### Do not store `boolean`
{id="option-do-not-store"}

Global: `UPLOADCARE_DO_NOT_STORE` <br/>
Local: `data-do-not-store` <br/>
Object key: `doNotStore` <br/>

Forces files uploaded with a file uploader not to be
[stored][api-reference-upload].
For instance, you might want to turn this on when *autostore*
is enabled in your project, but you aren’t willing to
store files uploaded with a particular file uploader.


### Validators `array`
{id="option-validators"}

Global: *N/A* <br/>
Local: *N/A* <br/>
Object key: `validators` <br/>

JavaScript-only option. Defines an array of validation functions.
See [validators documentation][api-reference-js-file-validation].


### Boolean options
{id="boolean-options"}

All `boolean` options are set globally with
general JavaScript boolean values.

```js
UPLOADCARE_CLEARABLE = true;
UPLOADCARE_PREVIEW_STEP = false;
```

When setting boolean options locally in HTML tag attributes,
any value is interpreted as `true`, even an empty one.
However, when setting local options to `false`,
an attribute value should strictly be either
`"false"` or `"disabled"`.

Setting a local option to `true`:

```html
<input data-option="data-option" />
<input data-option="true" />
<input data-option="" />
<input data-option />
```

Setting a local option to `false`:

```html
<input data-option="false" />
<input data-option="disabled" />
```


## Tabs (Upload Sources)
{id="tabs"}

The file uploader can upload files from local storages,
URLs, social media, and many other sources.
Each upload source has its own tab in the file uploader dialog.

A complete list of tabs supported in the file uploader version
(2.11.4) is provided below.

+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
|    Code     |          File Source               | Default |
+=============+====================================+=========+
| `file`      | Local disk                         | **On**  |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| `camera`    | Local webcam                       | **On**  |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| `url`       | Any URL                            | **On**  |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| `facebook`  | [Facebook][ext-facebook]           | **On**  |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| `gdrive`    | [Google Drive][ext-google-drive]   | **On**  |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| `gphotos`   | [Google Photos][ext-google-photos] | **On**  |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| `dropbox`   | [Dropbox][ext-dropbox]             | **On**  |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| `instagram` | [Instagram][ext-instagram]         | **On**  |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| `evernote`  | [Evernote][ext-evernote]           | **On**  |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| `flickr`    | [Flickr][ext-flickr]               | **On**  |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| `onedrive`  | [OneDrive][ext-onedrive]           | **On**  |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| `box`       | [Box][ext-box]                     | **Off** |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| `vk`        | [VK][ext-vkontakte]                | **Off** |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+
| `huddle`    | [Huddle][ext-huddle]               | **Off** |
+-------------+------------------------------------+---------+

The set can be reconfigured by specifying the tabs
you need as space-separated values.

**Globally**:

```html
<script>
  UPLOADCARE_TABS = 'url file facebook';
</script>
```

or **locally**:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader"
  data-tabs="url file facebook"
/>
```


## Input Value
{id="input-value"}

The value of the `[role=uploadcare-uploader]` input
may either be empty or contain a CDN link with file UUID.

If you set the input value externally and trigger the DOM change event,
it will be reflected in the widget. For example, setting it to a file UUID
or a [CDN link][delivery-cdn] will show that file in the widget as
an uploaded one. You can do this for a live widget or even before it loads.

Here’s an example of a predefined value:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader"
  data-public-key="demopublickey"
  value="https://ucarecdn.com/9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1/"
/>
<!--
  Also valid:
  value="9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1"
-->
```

<WidgetV2
  publicKey="232d896709883f79bfaf"
  value="9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1"
/>


## Styling
{id="styling"}

Our widget is designed to inherit styles from your page and
to be highly customizable at the same time.
All elements are scaled in line with font size.

<p style={{fontFamily: "Times New Roman", fontSize: "12px", lineHeight: "1.4"}}>
  Times New Roman, 12px:
  <WidgetV2
    clearable
    publicKey="232d896709883f79bfaf"
    value="9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1"
  />
</p>

<p style={{fontFamily: "Courier New", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.4"}}>
  Courier New, 18px:
  <WidgetV2
    clearable
    publicKey="232d896709883f79bfaf"
    value="9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1"
  />
</p>

Uploadcare Widget is thoroughly annotated with CSS classes
which can be styled on top of the defaults.
You can find the class for every item by inspecting
file uploader elements or sifting through the [original source][styles-widget].

You can also customize the look of upload dialog with
corresponding `uploadcare-dialog-*` classes.

More examples can be found in our [customization tutorial][file-uploader-styling].


## Custom Localization
{id="custom-localization"}

It’s possible that your locale is not available in the widget yet.
If that’s the case, contributing your locale might be a good idea.
This can be done by forking the [main repository][file-uploader-github-repo]
and adding a localization file [here][file-uploader-locale-github-list].

However, if you’d like to override text in specific parts of the widget,
you can configure it globally:

```js
UPLOADCARE_LOCALE = 'en';
UPLOADCARE_LOCALE_TRANSLATIONS = {
  buttons: {
    cancel: 'Cancel',
    remove: 'Remove',
    choose: {
      files: {
        one: 'Choose a file',
        other: 'Choose files'
      },
      images: {
        one: 'Choose an image',
        other: 'Choose images'
      }
    }
  }
};
```

Compare the structure above with
[default English localization][file-uploader-locale-github-en].
You should notice this overrides two strings in the original localization.

If a string is both missing in the selected localization and is not
overridden, English is used as a fallback. In fact, English is always
the most extensive localization for latest widget version.

## Pluralization
{id="pluralization"}

You might also want to override quantitative strings.
For example, `"1 file"` and `"3 files"`. This would require a special
structure as seen under the `file:` key in English localization.

Strings that are altered in line with a number of input features
are based on the output of a *pluralization function*.
The function, given an input number, returns the name of a subkey to use.

```js
function pluralize(number) {
  // do something
  return 'some_subkey';
}
```

There are two of such subkeys for English localization: `one` and `other`.
However, it might be more difficult in languages with more complex
pluralization rules. For example, take a look at `file:` subkeys
for [Russian][trans:russian] locale.

You might’ve noticed, to format a number into pluralized strings,
a `%1` sequence is used.

Each locale we provide with the widget is supplied with its
[pluralization rules][ext-unicode-pluralization].
But, if you wish to override those, you can write a custom function and assign
it to the [`UPLOADCARE_LOCALE_PLURALIZE`](#option-locale-pluralize) variable.

For example, the following configuration makes the widget to use
the message under the `some` subkey for numbers of files from 2 to 10.

```js
UPLOADCARE_LOCALE_TRANSLATIONS = {
  file: {
    one: 'Only one file! :(',
    some: 'Only %1 files. Upload more.',
    many: '%1 files!! That\'s a lot.'
  }
};
UPLOADCARE_LOCALE_PLURALIZE = function(n) {
  if (n === 1) return 'one';
  if (n > 1 && n <= 10) return 'some';
  return 'many';
};
```


## Requirements
{id="requirements"}

The widget doesn’t have any external dependencies except for **jQuery.**
We provide two versions of the widget: with built-in jQuery and without it
(see [usage](#install)).
For instance, when using the version with jQuery you could do that:

```js
var $ = uploadcare.jQuery;
$('body').append('It works!');
```

Our widget should work perfectly in a couple of the latest versions
of major desktop browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome,
Safari, and Opera. It is most likely to run well in older versions
of major browser too, except for Internet Explorer.

We support Internet Explorer 8 and 9 partially, some of the widget features
depend on functionalities that are lacking in those browsers.
Furthermore, we are using built-in jQuery 2.2.4 with no support for IE 8.
<a id="ie8" href="#ie8" />
**If you need to support IE 8,** you should make use of the ie8 widget version.

```html
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/2.11.4/uploadcare.ie8.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

or without jQuery and jQuery 1.x on top of it

```html{noAutoLinker}
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/2.x/uploadcare.light.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

## Automatic File Storing
{id="autostore"}

When the *autostore* feature is enabled in
[project settings][account-settings], uploaded files
are stored on our storage automatically. There’s no need
to additionally [store][api-reference-rest-store] them.
This might prove handy when your app retains most (or all)
of the uploaded files.

If *autostore* is disabled, you’d need to make a separate
server-side [API call][api-reference-rest-store] in
order to store your files. This should be done after a
form listing out uploaded files is submitted.
Files that weren’t through a
[store][api-reference-rest-store] operation are deleted
within a 24-hour time span.

If *autostore* is enabled in your project settings,
but you don’t want to store files uploaded with a particular widget,
check out [this](#option-do-not-store) option.


## Initialization
{id="initialization"}

By default, every new `[role=uploadcare-uploader]` element
appearing on a page (at any time) gets initialized as a widget
in about ~100 ms. A single JavaScript timer provides this behavior.
It shouldn’t have any impact on performance in typical applications.
However, if every cycle counts and you feel this is weighty,
consider disabling the [`UPLOADCARE_LIVE`](#option-live) option.

This way, you’d have to deal with
[manually][file-uploader-option-manual-start]
adding widget inputs after a page loads.

Though, all the file uploaders on a page would still be initialized
during its load. You might not want it, especially if you plan
introducing some preparations prior to instantiating file uploaders.
Consider using [`UPLOADCARE_MANUAL_START`](#option-manual-start)
together with `uploadcare.start()` in the case.
A `settings` object should be passed into `uploadcare.start()`
to override global settings. You can pass any global settings,
but keep in mind that keys are `camelCased`,
**not** `CAPITALIZED_WITH_UNDERSCORES`.

```js
UPLOADCARE_MANUAL_START = true;

jQuery(function($) {
  var $.getJSON('/uploadcare.json', function(data) {
    uploadcare.start({
      publicKey: data.publicKey, // overrides UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY
      crop: data.crop // overrides UPLOADCARE_CROP
    });
  });
});
```


## Manual Crop
{id="crop"}

Uploadcare Widget features custom crop. [Enabling it](#option-crop) will alter
the usual widget behavior. Now, after a user selects an image to upload,
a cropping step arises where that image can be cropped according
to your settings. Your project will still be supplied with the
original image itself, while cropping will be put into a resulting
CDN URL as the on-the-fly [CDN API operation][transformations-image-crop].

Crop options are put into a string holding one or more
comma-separated crop presets. When several presets are defined,
users will be able to pick any of them during the crop step.

Each preset consists of a size definition and an optional keyword.

* `"disabled"` — crop is disabled. Can’t be combined with other presets;
* `""` or `"free"` — crop is enabled and users will be able to freely
  select any area on an image;
* `"2:3"` — users will be able to select an area with the aspect ratio of 2:3;
* `"300x200"` — same as above, but if the selected area
  is greater than 300x200, it will be downscaled to fit the dimensions;
* `"300x200 upscale"` — same as above, but the area will be
  scaled even if it is smaller than the specified dimensions;
* `"300x200 minimum"` — users won’t be able to select an area smaller
  than 300x200. In case an image itself is smaller than 300x200,
  it will be upscaled.

### Crop examples
{id="crop-examples"}

Crop with **no restrictions**:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" data-images-only
  data-crop=""
/>
```

<WidgetV2
  imagesOnly
  crop
  publicKey="232d896709883f79bfaf"
  value="9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1"
/>

Five **presets with different aspect ratios,** one of which is free crop:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" data-images-only
  data-crop="free, 16:9, 4:3, 5:4, 1:1"
/>
```

<WidgetV2
  imagesOnly
  crop="free, 16:9, 4:3, 5:4, 1:1"
  publicKey="232d896709883f79bfaf"
  value="9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1"
/>

Crop with **fixed aspect ratio**:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" data-images-only
  data-crop="4:3"
/>
```

<WidgetV2
  imagesOnly
  crop="4:3"
  publicKey="232d896709883f79bfaf"
  value="9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1"
/>

Fixed-size crop with **upscaling**:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" data-images-only
  data-crop="400x300 upscale"
/>
```

<WidgetV2
  imagesOnly
  crop="400x300 upscale"
  publicKey="232d896709883f79bfaf"
  value="9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1"

## Shrink Images Before Uploading
{id="image-shrink"}

Sometimes you don’t want to have hi-res original images uploaded to your
account. Generally, sending large images is inefficient: especially when we’re
talking about transferring 10+ megapixel shots from your smartphone over some
mobile network. It’s either expensive or slow.

Image shrink option is provided as a string holding the preferred resolution
and, optionally, a JPEG quality of the resulting image (note, the original
aspect ratio will be preserved despite the set resolution.)

Image Shrink outputs to:

* JPEG in case an input image has no transparency.
* PNG in case an input image includes transparent pixels.

Here are some examples of values you can specify for `data-image-shrink` to
scontrol the feature:

* `800x600`, shrinks images to 0.48 megapixels with the default JPEG quality of
  80%.
* `1600x1600 95%`, shrinks images to 2.5 megapixels with the JPEG quality set to
  95%.

The resolution you set should not exceed 5 megapixels. All EXIF info from
original images (including orientation, camera model, geolocation, and settings)
will be copied to resized images.

Images won’t be shrunk in the following cases:

* if a browser does not support all the required APIs.
* if an image is uploaded from social sources or URL.
* if an image is less than two times larger than the preferred size.
  For example, an image with the resolution of 2560x1560px (4 MP) won’t be
  shrunk to 1600x1600px (2.5 MP), but a 2448x3264px (8 MP) one will.
  The reason is in the first case the decline in quality will be significant,
  while the drop in file size will stay relatively low.

### Shrink examples
{id="image-shrink-examples"}

Shrink to **1024x1024 pixels**:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader"  data-preview-step=""
  data-image-shrink="1024x1024"
/>
```

<WidgetV2
  imageShrink="1024x1024"
  previewStep
/>

The widget, capable of **shrinking multiple files**
to the resolution of 640x480 pixels (0.3 MP.):

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader"
  data-multiple=""
  data-image-shrink="640x480"
/>
```

<WidgetV2
  multiple=""
  imageShrink="640x480"
/>


## Mobile Layout
{id="mobile"}

Starting from the version 1.0.0, our web widget can be
properly used on mobile devices. On small screens, the uploading dialog
gets opened full-screen, and layout is changed for the sake of
better user experience. This feature is turned on automatically
on pages with the proper `<meta name="viewport">` tag.
Viewport tag reports which screen size was expected when
you created a page. It is required for all responsive websites.
If your site does not support responsive issues, but you still want
to provide mobile devices with the appropriate Uploadcare Widget,
you can include this relatively safe viewport tag to your page:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

This tag will trigger a mobile browser to show your page with 1:1 initial zoom,
but will still allow users to adjust the zoom manually.
