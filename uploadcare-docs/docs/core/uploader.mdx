## Glossary

-  **Widget** is a form element, a button that says "Choose files":

<img
	src="https://ucarecdn.com/37f2b572-29ac-43e4-8b31-a139ed378b9a/-/preview/-/format/auto/widget.png"
	alt="Uploadcare Widget"
	width={440}
/>

-  A click on the widget usually opens the **Uploader Dialog** — a modal window that allows file
   selection from multiple sources, optional file editing and much more with custom tabs:

![Uploader UI](https://ucarecdn.com/5f1a177a-404a-42cf-951a-d1f2b9aed79e/-/preview/-/format/auto/uploaderui.png)

-  Dialog can be opened programmatically. A Dialog can also be opened without a widget, in that case
   it's called **Standalone Dialog**.
-  A Dialog can be opened in embedded mode, just rendering its contents not into a modal but into an
   arbitrary HTML element. An embedded dialog is called **Panel**.
-  Dialog and Panel have identical APIs.

## Installation options

### Global installation

If you want to use the Uploader as an HTML input, presumably on a static webpage without any
framework, it's better to load Uploadcare globally.

Include this into the `<head>`:

```html
<script>
	UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'demopublickey'
</script>
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/3.x/uploadcare.full.min.js"></script>
```

If you already use jQuery, you can use the alternative bundle that comes without jQuery, so you
won't download it twice:

```html
<script>
	UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'demopublickey'
</script>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/3.x/uploadcare.min.js"></script>
```

Now you can use the Uploader:

```jsx
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" name="my_file_input" />
```

That way, you can configure the Uploader with **global variables** and **data-attributes**:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" data-public-key="demopublickey" data-images-only />
```

```html
<script>
	UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'demopublickey'
	UPLOADCARE_LOCALE = 'ru'
</script>
```

For every option we provide, there exists either a global variable, a data-attribute or both. **The
full list of options** is available below.

### NPM

If you want to seamlessly integrate Uploadcare into your project and want to retain full control
over Uploadcare widget UI, it's better to install our NPM library.

```jsx
npm install uploadcare-widget

import uploadcare from 'uploadcare-widget'
```

You can display and hide the Uploader programmatically. You also can configure it with
**configuration object**:

```jsx
uploadcare.openDialog(null, {
	publicKey: 'demopublickey',
	imagesOnly: true,
	crop: '300x200',
})
```

**The full list of options** is available below.

## Configuration

You can configure the Uploader the easy way by using the
[File Uploader Configurator](https://uploadcare.com/widget/configure).

<ConfigurationOptions />

## Types

### `fileInfo`

<FileInfo />

### `originalImageInfo`

<OriginalImageInfo />

### `fileGroupInfo`

<FileGroupInfo />

### `uploadInfo`

<UploadInfo />

## Controlling the UI programmatically

### Initialization

```jsx
const widgets = uploadcare.initialize('#my-form')
> [widget1, widget2, ...]
```

Accepts an optional selector of the root element. Looks for `[role="uploadcare-uploader"]` child
elements of the root. Returns an array of Uploader objects. Called automatically on page load unless
the **Manual start** parameter is `true`.

### Getting the Uploader

```jsx
const widget = uploadcare.Widget('#uploader')
```

Accepts a selector, returns an Uploader object.

If you want to target either Single or Multiple uploaders exclusively, you can use the respective
methods:

```jsx
const multiWidget = uploadcare.MultipleWidget('#uploader')
const singleWidget = uploadcare.SingleWidget('#uploader')
```

A Multiple Uploader is an uploader with `data-multiple` set to `true` or otherwise initialized with
that option. If a `MultipleWidget()` encounters a single-file uploader or `SingleWidget()`
encounters a multi-file one, an exception is thrown.

### Getting a value

```jsx
const file = widget.value()
```

Returns a File instance, a FileGroup instance or `null`.

### Setting a value

```jsx
singleWidget.value(file)
singleWidget.value('9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1')
singleWidget.value(null)
```

A Single Uploader object `value` method accepts either a File instance, a UUID of a file. Passing a
`null` will reset the uploader.

```jsx
multiWidget.value(fileGroup)
multiWidget.value([file1, file2, '9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1'])
multiWidget.value('cdf2fe62-3d43-47d4-9288-c3951561f5c7~2')
multiWidget.value(null)
```

A Multiple Uploader accepts an instance of FileGroup, a UUID of a file group or an array of values
that can be individually passed to a single uploader.

### Setting a value via HTML

If you set a new `value` attribute in HTML, you should do the following next:

```jsx
widget.reloadInfo()
```

This will propagate the new value to everywhere it needs to be.

### Opening the Uploader dialog

```jsx
const dialog = widget.openDialog(tab)
```

`tab` is a name of the tab that will be opened by default. Here are available built-in tabs:

-  `camera` is for a webcam;
-  `url` is for direct uploads with any URL;
-  `facebook` is for [Facebook](https://facebook.com/);
-  `gdrive` is for [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/);
-  `gphotos` is for [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/);
-  `dropbox` is for [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/);
-  `instagram` is for [Instagram](http://instagram.com/);
-  `evernote` is for [Evernote](https://evernote.com/);
-  `flickr` is for [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/);
-  `onedrive` is for [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/);
-  `box` is for [Box](http://www.box.com/), off by default;
-  `vk` is for [VK](http://vk.com/), off by default;
-  `huddle` is for [Huddle](https://www.huddle.com/), off by default.

### Opening the Uploader dialog without a widget

A dialog without a widget is called **standalone**.

```jsx
const dialog = uploadcare.openDialog(files, tab)
const dialog = uploadcare.openDialog(files, tab, settings)
```

Accepts the following arguments:

-  `tab` — a name of the tab opened by default;
-  `files` — a File instance, a FileGroup instance or an array of File instances. The files will be
   shown as if they were already uploaded;
-  `settings` — a Settings object.

Returns a DialogApi instance.

### Opening the Uploader Dialog in embedded mode

You can open the Uploader dialog in an **embedded mode**. It will be rendered right onto your
webpage and not inside a modal.

```jsx
const dialog = uploadcare.openPanel(placeholder, files, tab, settings)
```

`placeholder` is a string containing a selector of the element to be replaced with the Uploader
dialog. After the dialog is resolved (e.g. files uploaded), the placeholder element is put back.

Other parameters are similar to those of `uploadcare.openDialog()`.

Returns a DialogApi instance.

### Resolving a dialog

```jsx
dialog.resolve()
```

Resolve a dialog with currently selected files.

### Discarding a dialog

```jsx
dialog.reject()
```

Close the dialog and discard any file selection.

### Adding files to a dialog

```jsx
dialog.addFiles([file1, file2, file3])
```

Add an array of files to your dialog result set. The argument should be an array of File instances.

### Getting dialog files list

```jsx
const files = dialog.fileColl.__items
```

This field contains an array of files that are currently present in the Dialog.

### Dialog tabs

```jsx
dialog.switchTab('facebook')
```

Switches a dialog to a tab of provided name. The name you provide should be present in the
`settings.tabs` array.

```jsx
dialog.showTab('facebook')
dialog.hideTab('facebook')
```

Hides or shows a tab of provided name.

```jsx
const isFacebookVisible = dialog.isTabVisible('facebook')
```

Returns `true` if a tab of provided name is visible.

## Internationalization and changing text labels

```jsx
UPLOADCARE_LOCALE = 'en'
```

Supported locales are:

-  `ar` — Arabic
-  `az` — Azeri
-  `ca` — Catalan
-  `cs` — Czech
-  `da` — Danish
-  `de` — German
-  `el` — Greek
-  `en` — English
-  `es` — Spanish
-  `et` — Estonian
-  `fr` — French
-  `he` — Hebrew
-  `it` — Italian
-  `ja` — Japanese
-  `ko` — Korean
-  `lv` — Latvian
-  `nb` — Norwegian
-  `nl` — Dutch
-  `pl` — Polish
-  `pt` — Portuguese
-  `ro` — Romanian
-  `ru` — Russian
-  `sk` — Slovak
-  `sr` — Serbian
-  `sv` — Swedish
-  `tr` — Turkish
-  `uk` — Ukrainian
-  `vi` — Vietnamese
-  `zhTW` — Chinese (Taiwan)

You can use your own, custom translation on top of an existing locale, or even design your own
translation from the ground up:

```jsx
UPLOADCARE_LOCALE = 'en'
UPLOADCARE_LOCALE_TRANSLATIONS = {
	buttons: {
		cancel: 'Cancel',
		remove: 'Remove',
		choose: {
			files: {
				one: 'Choose a file',
				other: 'Pick files',
			},
		},
	},
	file: {
		one: 'Only one file! :(',
		some: 'Only %1 files. Upload more.',
		many: "%1 files!! That's a lot.",
	},
}
```

You can override only some text labels of the locale you choose.

`%1` in text labels will be replaced with a number that's being displayed. Uploadcare supports
Unicode pluralization rules, hence `one`, `some` and `many`. English, as a language of the Germanic
family, only has two plural forms (one and many). Other languages may have more.

You can define your own pluralization function:

```jsx
UPLOADCARE_LOCALE_PLURALIZE = function (n) {
	if (n === 1) return 'one'
	if (n > 1 && n <= 10) return 'some'
	return 'many'
}
```

You can use our
[locales catalog](https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-widget/tree/master/src/locales) on GitHub
as a reference.

## Uploading without Uploader with JavaScript API

### Single file

Create a File instance:

```jsx
const file = uploadcare.fileFrom('url', 'https://example.com/image.png')
const file = uploadcare.fileFrom('object', input.files[0])
const file = uploadcare.fileFrom('input', input)
const file = uploadcare.fileFrom('uploaded', '61783708-7090-4d6a-b82b-81f98e40a327')
```

`fileFrom` supports the following descriptors:

-  URL strings;
-  Native file objects from `<input type="file">`;
-  HTML inputs;
-  UUIDs of already uploaded files.

Uploading process will start automatically.

Also, `fileFrom` accepts an optional `settings` object as the third argument.

Here's how to cancel the upload:

```jsx
file.cancel()
```

### Multiple files

Create a FileGroup instance:

```jsx
const fileGroup = uploadcare.FileGroup([file1, fileGroup1, file2])
```

`FileGroup()` method accepts an array of File or FileGroup instances. You can combine multiple
groups in one.

You can also load a group from the CDN:

```jsx
uploadcare
	.loadFileGroup('cdf2fe62-3d43-47d4-9288-c3951561f5c7~2')
	.done(fileGroup => {})
	.fail(error => {})
```

You can get a list of files in the group like this:

```jsx
const files = fileGroup.files()
```

This method returns an array of File instances.

## Events

### File

```jsx
file.done(fileInfo => {})
file.progress(uploadInfo => {})
file.fail((error, fileInfo) => {})
```

-  `done` is fired when the upload is successfully completed and the file is ready;
-  `progress` is fired periodically as the file is being uploaded. It fires at least once, the first
   fire happens right after the callback is attached;
-  `fail` is fired when there was an error when uploading a file. It accepts the following error
   statuses:
   -  `'baddata'` if an invalid argument passed to the file constructor;
   -  `'size'` if the file size is too large;
   -  `'upload'` if there was a network error during upload;
   -  `'user'` if the upload was cancelled by user;
   -  `'info'` if there was an error while fetching file information;
   -  `'deleted'` if the file was deleted. Works best with file groups.

### FileGroup

```jsx
const groupPromise = fileGroup.promise()

groupPromise.done(fileGroupInfo => {})
groupPromise.progress(uploadInfo => {})
groupPromise.fail((error, fileGroupInfo) => {})
```

Events are the same as in the File instance.

### Widget

```jsx
widget.onChange(file => {})
widget.onUploadComplete(fileInfo => {})
widget.onDialogOpen(dialogApi => {})
```

-  `onChange` is fired when an Uploader value changes. It receives a File or a FileGroup instance
   for Single and Multiple uploaders, respectively.
-  `onUploadComplete` is fired when a value changes and the files are uploaded to Uploadcare and
   available via their UUID. It receives an fileInfo or fileGroupInfo object for Single and Multiple
   uploaders, respectively.
-  `onDialogOpen` is fired when a user clicks the "Upload" button or a dialog is shown via the
   JavaScript API. It receives a DialogApi instance.

You can unsubscribe like that:

```jsx
widget.onChange(foo)
widget.onChange.remove(foo)
```

It works for every event.

### Dialog and Panel

```jsx
dialog.done(files => {})
dialog.fail(lastSelected => {})
dialog.always(() => {})

dialog.onTabVisibility((tabName, isVisible) => {})
dialog.progress(tabName => {})
```

-  `done` is fired when a dialog is closed and some files are selected. It accepts either File or
   FileGroup for Single or Multiple uploaders, respectively.
-  `fail` is fired when a dialog is closed without any files selected. Accepts the last selected
   File or FileGroup.
-  `always` is fired in both cases when `done` and `fail` is fired. Accepts nothing.
-  `onTabVisibility` is fired when tab visibility changes. For example, it fires when `hideTab` or
   `showTab` is called. Accepts two arguments:
   -  `tabName` — string, a name of the tab that is subject to a visibility change;
   -  `isVisible` — boolean, whether the tab of `tabName` became visible.

### File Collection (Dialog and Panel)

```jsx
dialog.fileColl.onAdd.add(file => {}}
dialog.fileColl.onRemove.add(file => {})
dialog.fileColl.onReplace.add((oldFile, newFile) => {})
dialog.fileColl.onSort.add(() => {})
```

For technical reasons, `fileColl` events use a slightly different API for adding event listeners.
However, the unsubscribe API is the same:

```jsx
const foo = () => {}

// subscribe
dialog.fileColl.onAdd.add(foo)

// unsubscribe
dialog.fileColl.onAdd.remove(foo)
```

---

-  `onAdd` is fired when a file is added to the Dialog. Accepts a File instance.
-  `onRemove` is fired when a file is removed from the Dialog. Accepts a File instance.
-  `onReplace` is fired when a file is replaced. A replace event can happen when you have a crop
   enabled, and the user changes the crop on an existing image. Accepts two File instances, one
   represents a file before the replacement, and another is the same file after.
-  `onSort` is fired when user changes file order with drag and drop. Accepts nothing.

## Styling

Uploader uses a CSS methodology and can be easily customized. Every UI element has a class name
prefixed with `uploadcare--`.

You can stylize Uploader just by adding a plain CSS file where you override and extend the default
styles of respective Uploader UI elements.

If Uploader is opened inside an iframe and is out of a global CSS scope, you can inject CSS this
way:

```jsx
const style = `
	.uploadcare--panel__content {
		font-size: small;
	}
`
uploadcare.tabsCss.addStyle(style)
```

You can also provide an HTTPS link to the stylesheet:

```jsx
uploadcare.tabsCss.addUrl('https://yourdomain.com/uploadcare.css')
```

HTTP links are not supported. If you want to inject a file with `addUrl`, you should use HTTPS.

## Validating user uploads

```jsx
widget.validators.push(fileInfo => {})
```

You can provide multiple validator functions. Each function receives an object of `fileInfo` type as
a first argument.

If a validator function throws, validation is considered failed. If it doesn't, validation is
passed.

Typical validators are already built-in and are accessible using Uploader options.

## Letting users crop images before upload

You should set `data-crop` attribute:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" name="my_file" data-crop="" />
```

Possible values are:

-  `disabled`
-  `free` or empty string — free crop
-  `A:B`, e.g. `2:3`, `3:4`, `16:9`, etc. — crop to certain aspect ratio
-  `AxB`, e.g. `200x200`, etc. — same as the above, but if a larger area is selected, resulting
   image will be downscaled
-  `AxB upscale`, e.g. `200x200 upscale`, etc. — same as the above, but if a smaller area is
   selected, resulting image will be upscaled
-  `AxB minimum`, e.g. `800x600 minimum` — user won't be able to select an area smaller than 800x600
   pixels. If an uploaded image is smaller, it will be upscaled before the crop UI is shown.

You can specify multiple allowed aspect ratios:

```html
data-crop="free, 1:1, 3:4, 16:9"
```

Arbitrary ratios are also allowed:

```html
data-crop="3:4, 13:14, 101:102, 25:27"
```

## Adding custom tabs

First, you need to define a tab constructor function and register the tab:

```jsx
const customTab = (container, button, api, settings, name) => {}
uploadcare.registerTab('foo', customTab)
```

The constructor is called every time the Uploader is opened. Here are the arguments:

-  `container` — jQuery object of your tab's container. Tab's content should be rendered here.
-  `button` — jQuery object of your tab's button.
-  `api` — dialogApi instance of the opened Uploader. You can control uploading workflow from here.
-  `settings` — settings object that was passed to `uploadcare.openDialog` when this very Uploader
   was opened.
-  `name` — the custom tab's name which it was registered with. In this example, it will be `foo`.

## Securing uploads

With Secure uploads, you can control who and when can upload files to your project storage. To use
this feature, **your app will need a backend**. Every call to the Upload API from now on should be
signed, and the signatures should be generated at your backend.

#### Enabling

To enable Secure uploading, go to your Dashboard and select your project. Next to _Secure
Uploading_, click _Enable_.

After that, go to _API Keys_ and click _Add secret key_. This key will be used for signing uploads.

#### Signing uploads

To create a signature, you should do the following:

1. Generate an expiry date.
2. Create a SHA256 HMAC of that expiry date and your secret key.
3. Get a hex digest of that HMAC. This is your signature.
4. Convert the expiry date to Unix time
5. Transfer that signature and the expiry date to the frontend securely.

Here's an example for NodeJS:

```jsx
const crypto = require('crypto')

// 120 seconds from now
const expire = (Math.round(Date.now() / 1000) + 120).toString()
const secret = 'project_secret_key'
const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)
hmac.update(expire)

const signature = hmac.digest('hex')
```

Now you can use that signature in multiple ways:

-  By setting the `UPLOADCARE_SECURE_SIGNATURE` and `UPLOADCARE_SECURE_EXPIRE` global variables;
-  By setting the `data-secure-signature` and `data-secure-expire` data-attributes of your Uploader;
-  By specifying the `secureSignature` and `secureExpire` keys in your Uploader settings object if
   you're using JavaScript API;
-  By passing `signature` and `expire` parameters along with a REST API request.

## Handling previews when using Secure Delivery

After uploading, File Uploader loads image previews from the CDN:

```jsx
> (GET) https://ucarecdn.com/:uuid/
```

With Secure Delivery on, File Upload can't show previews like that, because requests need to be
signed.

To enable preview, there are two options:

-  `previewProxy`, which makes Uploader send requests to a custom URL you defined. It works best if
   you have a cookie-based authentication, and both your proxy backend and your app are located on
   the same domain (otherwise cookies won't be sent).
-  `previewUrlCallback`, which allows passing a function to generate URLs on the client side. Note
   that this option overrides `previewProxy`.

#### `previewProxy`

Enable it by setting `UPLOADCARE_PREVIEW_PROXY` global variable, `data-preview-proxy` data-attribute
or `previewProxy` configuration object key:

```jsx
UPLOADCARE_PREVIEW_PROXY = 'https://domain.com/preview?'
```

Uploader will make a request to this URL, passing the original image URL as a `url` query parameter.

#### `previewUrlCallback`

The callback signature is `(originalUrl, fileInfo) => previewUrl`.

Enable it by setting `UPLOADCARE_PREVIEW_URL_CALLBACK` global variable or `previewUrlCallback`
configuration object key:

```jsx
UPLOADCARE_PREVIEW_URL_CALLBACK = (originalUrl, fileInfo) => {
	return (
		`https://domain.com/preview?` +
		`originalUrl=${encodeURIComponent(originalUrl)}&` +
		`uuid=${fileInfo.uuid}`
	)
}
```
