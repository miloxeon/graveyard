# File Uploader API v3 Reference

<!--
Rewrite
A deep access to Uploader functions and settings. Not only GUI shit but all the stuff you could ever need to handle uploads.

File Uploader API is an extensive set of tools that allows you adjust File
Uploader behavior and implement various uploading worfkflows. For example,
upload files from URL, moderate uploaded content, adjust File Uploader widget
appearance to match your website or app.

As stated in the [File Uploader configuration section][file-uploader-config],
[File Uploader options][file-uploader-options] can be set in three ways.

* Globally, on page load.
* Locally, when a new File Uploader object is created.
* By passing the `settings` object.

JavaScript global variables will go in your `<script>` tag:

```html
<script>
  UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'demopublickey';
  UPLOADCARE_LOCALE = 'ru';
</script>
```

Local options can be set in the `<input>` element as data attributes:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader"
  data-public-key="demopublickey"
  data-images-only
/>
```

You can also pass most of the File Uploader options as an argument holding the
`settings` [object][file-uploader-config-object] to the methods listed
in this JavaScript API reference. For instance:

```js
uploadcare.openDialog(null, {
  publicKey: 'demopublickey',
  imagesOnly: true,
  crop: '300x200'
});
```
