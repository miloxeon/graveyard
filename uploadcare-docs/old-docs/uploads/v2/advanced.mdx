## Access to Canvas Pixels
{id="access-canvas-pixels"}

It is a great idea to use images from our CDN on HTML canvas.
Unfortunately browsers restrict access to canvas if an image was downloaded
from untrusted source. By default only images from the same origin
are treated as trusted. If you’ll draw the image from other origins,
the canvas will be marked as “dirty” and no pixel read will be possible
from the canvas.

Calling `getImageData()` or `toDataURL()` will lead to `SecurityError`:

```js
canvas.toDataURL();
// Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'toDataURL' on 'HTMLCanvasElement': Tainted canvases may not be exported.
canvas.getContext('2d').getImageData(0, 0, 100, 100);
// Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'getImageData' on 'CanvasRenderingContext2D': The canvas has been tainted by cross-origin data.
```

One of solutions is using `crossOrigin` image property
to ask browser to request the image in a safe way.

Unfortunately this property is available only in Chrome and Firefox.
But it is very easy to make such request manually with the help of
`XMLHttpRequest`.

This works well in Chrome 19+, Firefox 6+, IE 10+, Safari 6+ and Opera 15+.


## Uploaded Files Browser
{id="uploaded-files-browser"}

Often you may want to allow user to choose previously uploaded files again.
Uploadcare doesn’t store relations between users and files
and also doesn’t allow the file uploader to list all files in the project
for security reasons.

There are two ways to handle the files-to-user relations:

1. You can store this information on your side and
  load list of user’s files using AJAX requests to your server.
  This is relatively complex way because you’ll need to implement some storage
  and endpoint which will return file list from this storage.
2. List of previously uploaded files can be stored locally on user’s computer
  in browser’s local storage. This way user will not be able to choose files
  uploaded from other devices, but this doesn’t require any support on
  server side.

Following example shows how to add local storage history tab
with following features:

* Lists are separated by public key. If you are using file uploaders
  with two or more public keys, only files from current project will be shown.
* List of last 50 files are shown.
* If file uploader has images-only flag, only image files will be shown.
* User can remove files from history.
