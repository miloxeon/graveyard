# Creating a Django app with Uploadcare

[Uploadcare][home] is an end-to-end file API that allows you to fully manage
file uploading, storage, transformations, and delivery. All that is included in
our [Python][guide-python] and [Django][ext-django-home] integrations.

In this guide, we'll create an app with an Instagram-like grid feed and image
uploading:

`pyuploadcare` is an official Uploadcare Python library providing wrappers for
file uploading, API interactions, and Image Transformations. In this guide,
we'll stick with using `ImageField`, a [File Uploader][file-uploader]
implementation for Django.

## Requirements

* Python 2.7+
* Django

[Full compatibility list][pyuploadcare-github-requirements]

If you're using `pyuploadcare` with Django, check `.travis.yml` for supported
Python-Django combinations.

## Installation

Our Python library, `pyuploadcare`, consists of the Uploadcare API interface and
a couple of Django goodies. Although it isn‚Äôt necessary to go with Django, we'll
use it to build a sample project.

It‚Äôs a good practice to always use a per-project [virtualenv][ext-python-venv]
when developing locally with Python. It's also a good way to get around the
Python versions ambiguity. Generally, you create and activate a virtual
environment this way:

```bash
pip install --upgrade virtualenv
cd instagrid # your project directory

# For Linux/MacOS
virtualenv --python python3 instagrid
source instagrid/bin/activate

# For Windows
virtualenv --python "c:\python36\python.exe" instagrid
.\instagrid\Scripts\activate
```

If the commands worked out, your CLI prompt should change like this:

```bash
(instagrid) HostName:WorkingDirectory UserName$
```

Now you can install Django and `pyuploadcare`:

```bash
pip install django
pip install pyuploadcare
```

## Create a Django Project

Let‚Äôs start with creating the project:

```bash
django-admin startproject instagrid
cd instagrid
python manage.py runserver
```

After running these three commands, open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your
browser. You should already see the Django welcome screen:

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/294133aa-5853-47c9-8b1b-e08edea69b65/-/preview/-/resize/680x/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/guide-django-welcome.png"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/294133aa-5853-47c9-8b1b-e08edea69b65/-/preview/-/resize/1360x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/-/progressive/yes/guide-django-welcome.png 2x"
    alt="Django Welcome Screen" /><br/>

Now stop the server using `Ctrl+C` and run default Django migrations, which
Django asks to apply every time you run the server:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Configuration
{id="settingup-prepare"}

Open the `/instagrid/settings.py` file and find the `INSTALLED_APPS` section.
There, add lines for your app name and `pyuploadcare`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'instagrid',
    'pyuploadcare.dj',
    ...
]
```

This, among other things, allows Django to look for `models.py` in your
app‚Äôs directory.

Also, in the same file, find the definition of `DIRS` in the `TEMPLATES`
section. Here we will add the path to the templates directory:

```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
        ...
    },
]
```

The last thing related to this file is your Uploadcare config. Put the API Keys
you discovered earlier in this guide somewhere in the file like another settings
variable:

```python
UPLOADCARE = {
    'pub_key': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
    'secret': 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
}

WSGI_APPLICATION = ...
```

### Creating a Model
{id="settingup-model"}

Say, we would like to store the info about uploaded images in a database.
Create a new file under `/instagrid/` named `models.py`.
Here‚Äôs the sample model we will put there:

```python
from django.db import models
from pyuploadcare.dj.models import ImageField


class Post(models.Model):
    photo = ImageField(blank=True, manual_crop="")
```

[ImageField][ext-pyuploadcare-imagefield] is the `pyuploadcare` implementation
of our [File Uploader][file-uploader], which you can use as a regular
Django‚Äôs TextField.

Make and apply our app migrations to create a DB structure for the new model:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations instagrid
python manage.py migrate
```

### Create a Template and a View
{id="frontend"}

Now that we have done the groundwork for the app let‚Äôs make the app‚Äôs main
page. It will serve as an image gallery and a place for the ‚ÄúUpload‚Äù button too.

We will not describe the process of building an HTML page. More tips on it you
can easily find across the web.

Create the `templates` folder under your project‚Äôs main directory (it‚Äôs near the
`manage.py`), and put your [index.html file][ucarecdn-index-html] there.

Open `index.html` in your text editor, and note the following.
The `form.media` here is a default Django form property which is going to
render any scripts needed for the form to work, in our case ‚Äì Uploadcare
scripts:

```html
<head>
  <title>Instagrid</title>
  {{ form.media }}
</head>
```

The following is the Django way of displaying forms:

```html
<form action="" method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ form }}
  <input type="submit" value="Save"/>
</form>
```

And here is the part that renders uploaded images, which data are stored in DB.
We‚Äôre using some capabilities of our
[Image Transformations][transformations-image-crop] to crop an image and define its
quality:

```html
{% if posts %}
{% for post in posts %}
<div class="col-md-4">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ post.photo.cdn_url }}-/crop/600x600/center/-/quality/lightest/" alt=""></div>
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

The last thing in this step is creating a **view.** Views help Django know what
template should be displayed and what data should be passed there.

Create a new file named `views.py` under the `/instagrid/` directory in your
app. Put there the following code:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .models import Post
from .forms import PostForm

def home(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = PostForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            post = form.save(commit=False)
            post.save()
    else:
        form = PostForm()

    try:
        posts = Post.objects.all()
    except Post.DoesNotExist:
        posts = None

    return render(request, 'index.html', { 'posts': posts, 'form': form })
```

This code is just slightly different from any basic tutorial‚Äôs one. Here we
define the `home` view, which saves the form data on POST request and passes
all the objects stored in `Post` DB.

To make view show up on the site, you have to also change the
`/instagrid/urls.py` like that:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', views.home)
]
```

### Create a Form
{id="fe_be"}

We created a Post model in the first step and an `index.html` template together
with the `home` view in the second. To make them work together, we need to
implement the last component in our sample app ‚Äì a form.

First, create the `forms.py` file under the `/instagrid/` directory in your
project.

The simplest way is to create a form from a model. Insert the following snippet
into the newly created file:

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Post
from pyuploadcare.dj.forms import ImageField

class PostForm(forms.ModelForm):
    photo = ImageField(label='')

    class Meta:
        model = Post
        fields = ('photo',)
```

You can read more about how these are built in
[Django Docs][ext-django-modelforms]. One thing to note is the following line:

```python
photo = ImageField(label='')
```

We set the `label` to an empty string to ensure that we won‚Äôt have labels in our
form. Feel free to drop this argument if you like them üëç

Save all the edited files and run the server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Now open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser and play around with your
Instagrid application ‚ú®

## Next steps
{id="conclusion"}

There‚Äôs more to it: you can handle API requests and [Image Transformations][transformations-image],
and enable the In-Browser Image Editing feature with `pyuploadcare` too. To
