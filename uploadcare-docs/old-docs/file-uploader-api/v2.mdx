# JavaScript API Documentation

<Messages>
  <WidgetV2Warning link='/docs/file-uploader-api/' />
  <Migration />
</Messages>

You may not need all of the features
that [our file uploader][file-uploader] exhibits.
Or, perhaps, you want to redesign the user experience, but don’t want to
reinvent the wheel. Or the task is simply to build some UI on top of the widget.
For all these use cases we provide a JavaScript API. Use it to control
the default widget, or do stuff without it via standalone components
that can be combined with your own solutions.

* [File Uploader](#widget)
* [Files and Uploads](#file)
* [File Group](#file-group)
* [Files Validation](#validation)
* [Upload Dialog and Panel](#dialog)
* [Custom Tabs](#custom-tabs)
* [Drag and drop](#drag-and-drop)
* [Source tabs styling](#sources-style)

## Widget
{id="widget"}

File uploader can handle one file ([single-upload](#file-widget))
or multiple files at once ([multi-upload](#file-multiple-widget)).

**Initializes widget** instances once (either [single-upload](#file-widget),
or [multi-upload](#file-multiple-widget))
on every element with `role="uploadcare-uploader"` attribute
in a container, specified by selector or DOM element.
If container is absent the document is used.
Returns array of new initialized widgets, or empty array
if no new instances were initialized.

```js
var widgets = uploadcare.initialize('#my-form');
widgets; // [widget1, widget2, multipleWidget1, ...]
var widgets = uploadcare.initialize();
```

This method is called automatically unless
[manual start][file-uploader-option-manual-start]
is defined.


---

<a id="single-widget" /><a id="file-widget" />

**Get the widget** instance for a given element.

```js
var singleWidget = uploadcare.SingleWidget('[role=uploadcare-uploader]');
```

Element argument can be a DOM element, a jQuery object,
or a CSS selector. If element’s argument is a CSS selector,
only the instance for the first matched element will be returned.
To make sure you get the right instance when there are multiple widgets
on the page, select by id or pass in a DOM element.

All [options][file-uploader-options] will be loaded from
element’s data-attributes on the first initialization.

If passed element has `data-multiple` attribute, an error will be raised.
[Multi-upload File Uploader](#file-multiple-widget) should be used in this case.


---
<a id="multiple-widget" /><a id="file-multiple-widget" />

**Get the multiple widget** instance for a given element with the `data-multiple`
[option][file-uploader-option-multiple] turned on.

```js
var multiWidget = uploadcare.MultipleWidget('[role=uploadcare-uploader][data-multiple]');
```

Works the same as the constructor for [single-upload file uploader](#file-widget).
If an instance of the first element is **not** a
multi-upload widget, error is raised.


---
<a id="any-widget" />

**Get the single or multiple widget** instance depending on
`data-multiple` attribute.
The API for single and multiple widgets is slightly different.
Use this constructor when the code can work with both of them.

```js
var widget = uploadcare.Widget('[role=uploadcare-uploader]');
```


---
<a id="single-widget-value" />

**Set a [file instance](#file)** as a value for the
[single-upload file uploader](#file-widget).

```js
singleWidget.value(file);
```

Set a file UUID or a [CDN link][delivery-cdn] as a value.

```js
singleWidget.value('9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1');
```

Set `null` as a value to clear the widget.

```js
singleWidget.value(null);
```


---
<a id="multiple-widget-value" />

**Set a [group instance](#file-group)** as a value for the
[multi-upload file uploader](#file-multiple-widget).

```js
multiWidget.value(fileGroup);
```

Set an array of file instances or UUIDs as a value for the
[multi-upload file uploader](#file-multiple-widget).

```js
multiWidget.value([file1, file2, '9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1']);
```

Set a [file group](#file-group) identifier as a value for the
[multi-upload file uploader](#file-multiple-widget).

```js
multiWidget.value('cdf2fe62-3d43-47d4-9288-c3951561f5c7~2');
```


---

**Get current widget value**: file instance, group instance or `null`.

```js
var file = widget.value();
```


---
<a id="widget-reload-info" />

**Load new file or group** instance from `value` attribute of the `input`
(by UUID or CDN link), and update information about the object
from Uploadcare servers.

```js
widget.reloadInfo();
```


---
<a id="widget-open-dialog" />

**Open the dialog** of a specific widget and get its instance.
Result is [dialog API](#dialog-api).

```js
var dialog = widget.openDialog(tab);
```

`tab` — name of a tab opened by default.


---
<a id="widget-on-change" />

**Do something after a new file is selected.**
An instance is passed to the callback:
[file](#file) for [single-upload file uploader](#file-widget),
or [file group](#file-group)
for [multi-upload file uploader](#file-multiple-widget).

It may or may not be uploaded.

```js
widget.onChange(function(file) {
  // Handle new file.
});
```


---
<a id="widget-on-upload-complete" />
Do something **after a file is uploaded and ready.**
The callback is passed an info object:
[file info](#file-info) for [single-upload file uploader](#file-widget),
or [file group info](#file-group-info)
for [multi-upload file uploader](#file-multiple-widget).

```js
widget.onUploadComplete(function(info) {
  // Handle uploaded file info.
});

// Same as above:
widget.onChange(function(file) {
  if (file) {
    file.done(function(info) {
      // Handle uploaded file info.
    });
  };
});
```


---
<a id="widget-on-dialog-open" />

Do something **when dialog is opened** (either by user’s click
or from [widget.openDialog](#widget-open-dialog) call).
Works only when [system dialog][file-uploader-option-system-dialog]
is not enabled.

```js
widget.onDialogOpen(function(dialogApi) {
  dialogApi.switchTab('dropbox');
});
```


---

**Unsubscribe any callback.**

```js
widget.onChange(fn); // Subscribe
widget.onChange.remove(fn); // Unsubscribe

widget.onUploadComplete(fn);
widget.onUploadComplete.remove(fn);

widget.onDialogOpen(fn);
widget.onDialogOpen.remove(fn);
```


## Files and Uploads
{id="file"}

File Uploader and Javascript API works with the file instances, which implement
jQuery [promise interface][ext-jquery-promise-interface].


---
<a id="file-wait-when-ready" href="#file-wait-when-ready" />

**Wait when the file is ready.** Returns [fileInfo](#file-info) object.

```js
file.done(function(fileInfo) {
  // Upload successfully completed and file is ready.
}).fail(function(error, fileInfo) {
  // Upload failed or something else went wrong.
});
```


---
<a id="file-uploading-progress" href="#file-uploading-progress" />

Watch for the file **uploading progress.**
Returns [uploadInfo](#upload-info) object.

```js
file.progress(function(uploadInfo) {
  // State of upload is updated.
  // This callback is invoked at least once with current state,
  // immediately after assignment.
});
```

Show file upload progress on a
[jQuery UI progressbar][ext-jquery-ui-progressbar].

```js
file.progress(function(uploadInfo) {
  $('#progress').progressbar('value', uploadInfo.progress);
});
```


---
<a id="file-new-instance" href="#file-new-instance" />

**A new file instance** can be constructed by calling **`fileFrom` factory function.**
First argument is one of the predefined identifiers, second is the file source.
Depending on the identifier, the function can start file uploading
or just return an instance of already uploaded file.


---
<a id="file-from-url" href="#file-from-url" />

**Upload a new file from an arbitrary URL.**

```js{noAutoLinker}
var file = uploadcare.fileFrom('url', 'http://example.com/image.png');
```


---
<a id="file-from-native" href="#file-from-native" />

Upload a new file **from a
[native file object][ext-native-file-object].**
This method supports uploading large files (> 100MB) and upload progress,
but it is not available on outdated browsers
(see [browsers support][ext-caniuse-fileapi]).

```js
var file = uploadcare.fileFrom('object', input.files[0]);
```


---
<a id="file-from-dom" href="#file-from-dom" />

Upload new file **from input DOM element.**
This method works in all browsers, but does not support large files
and uploading progress.

```js
var file = uploadcare.fileFrom('input', input);
```


---
<a id="file-from-cdn" href="#file-from-cdn" />

Create a file instance **from an uploaded file UUID or a
[CDN link][delivery-cdn]** and load info from Uploadcare server.

```js
var file = uploadcare.fileFrom('uploaded', '61783708-7090-4d6a-b82b-81f98e40a327');
```


---
<a id="file-cancel-uploading" href="#file-cancel-uploading" />

**Cancel any in-progress upload** immediately and stop all events.

```js
file.cancel();
```

+-------------------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

### uploadInfo
{id="upload-info"}

Structure of the `uploadInfo` object:

+----------------+--------+-------------------------------------------+
|    Property    |  Type  |                   Value                   |
+================+========+===========================================+
| state          | string | Current readiness state: `'uploading'`,   |
|                |        | `'uploaded'`, or `'ready'`.               |
+----------------+--------+-------------------------------------------+
| uploadProgress | number | Upload progress as a value from 0 to 1.   |
+----------------+--------+-------------------------------------------+
| progress       | number | File readiness (sum of upload progress    |
|                |        | and info preparation progress) as a value |
|                |        | from 0 to 1.                              |
+----------------+--------+-------------------------------------------+

The `error` argument in the `fail` callback is one of the following values,
or a user-defined value, raised in the [validators](#validation).

* `'baddata'` — invalid argument passed to file constructor
* `'size'` — file size is too large
* `'upload'` — error during upload
* `'user'` — upload cancelled
* `'info'` — error when fetching file information
* `'deleted'` — file was deleted (possible in a group)


## File Group
{id="file-group"}

Group is an ordered collection of [file instances](#file).
Once it is created, it can’t be modified, but you always can create
a new group with the same files.


---
<a id="file-group-create" href="#file-group-create" />

**Create a group** from an array of files and/or other groups.

```js
var fileGroup = uploadcare.FileGroup([file1, fileGroup1, file2]);
```

After a group instance is created, it can be uploaded to Uploadcare server
by calling `promise` method.


---
<a id="file-group-uploadinfo" href="#file-group-uploadinfo" />

**Subscribe to the group upload events.**
Wait until all files are uploaded and a group is created.

```js
var groupPromise = fileGroup.promise();
groupPromise.done(function(fileGroupInfo) {
  // Upload successfully completed and all files in the group are ready.
});
groupPromise.fail(function(error, fileGroupInfo) {
  // Upload failed or something else went wrong.
});
```

**Watch for total uploading progress.**

```js
groupPromise.progress(function(uploadInfo) {
  // State of upload is updated.
  // This callback is invoked at least once with current state,
  // immediately after assignment.
});
```


---
<a id="file-group-as-array" href="#file-group-as-array" />

**Get group files** as an array.

```js
var arrayOfFiles = fileGroup.files();
```

Get file infos in order of readiness.

```js
$.each(arrayOfFiles, function(i, file) {
  // Wait for file uploading.
  file.done(function(fileInfo) {
    // i is file positon in group.
    console.log(i, fileInfo);
  });
});
```

Get file infos in the order they are presented in the group.

```js
$.when.apply(null, arrayOfFiles).done(function() {
  // Info for each file will be passed as an argument.
  var fileInfos = arguments;
  $.each(fileInfos, function(i, fileInfo) {
    // i is file position in the group.
    console.log(i, fileInfo);
  });
});
```


---
<a id="file-group-from-cdn" href="#file-group-from-cdn" />

**Load a group from CDN** via its [identifier][delivery-group-api]
or CDN URL.

```js
uploadcare.loadFileGroup('cdf2fe62-3d43-47d4-9288-c3951561f5c7~2')
  .done(function(fileGroup) {
    // Group creation completed successfully.
  })
  .fail(function() {
    // Something went wrong.
  });
```


### fileGroupInfo
{id="file-group-info"}

Structure of the `fileGroupInfo` object:

| Property |  Type   |                                Value                                |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| uuid     | string  | File group [identifier][delivery-group-api].                        |
| name     | string  | Localized group size string, e.g. “5 files”.                        |
| size     | number  | Cumulative files size in bytes.                                     |
| isStored | boolean | `true` if **all** files in the group are stored, `false` otherwise. |
| isImage  | boolean | `true` if **all** files in the group are images, `false` otherwise. |
| cdnUrl   | string  | Public file group [CDN URL][delivery-group-api].                    |

## Files Validation
{id="validation"}

Validators allow restricting user choice to certain kind of files. For example
you may want to accept only files that are less than 2mb or only PDF documents.
Validator is a function that receives `fileInfo` object for each uploaded file
and should throw exception if the file does not meet requirements.

```js
function imagesOnly(fileInfo) {
  if (fileInfo.isImage === false) {
    throw new Error('image');
  }
}
```

Validators are called as soon as new information about the file
becomes available. All fields unknown at the calling time are `null`.
This means one validator can be called more than once for one file
and should test if validated field is not `null`.

```js
function maxDimensions(width, height) {
  return function(fileInfo) {
    var imageInfo = fileInfo.originalImageInfo;
    if (imageInfo !== null) {
      if (imageInfo.width > width || imageInfo.height > height) {
        throw new Error('dimensions');
      }
    }
  };
}
```


### Validation in widget
{id="widget-valiation"}

Validators for the widget can be added to the `validators` property of
file uploader instances (both single or multiple).

```js
var widget = uploadcare.Widget('#uploadcare-file');
widget.validators.push(imagesOnly);
```

`widget.validators` is regular javascript array.
One widget can have several assigned validators.
One validator can be ussigned to several widgets.

```js
firstWidget.validators.push(imagesOnly);
secondWidget.validators.push(imagesOnly);
firstWidget.validators.push(maxSize(1024 * 1024));
firstWidget.validators.push(maxDimensions(800, 600));
firstWidget.validators; // [function imagesOnly(){...}, function () {...}, function () {...}]
```

Note that you can’t rewrite it with another object.
If you don’t need some validators, you need to remove
them from original array.

```js
// Leave only first two validators:
widget.validators = widget.validators.splice(0, 2); // WRONG!
widget.validators.splice(2);  // Correct.

// Remove all validators:
widget.validators = [];       // WRONG!
widget.validators.length = 0; // Correct.
```


### Validation in javascript API
{id="javascript-valiation"}

You can add `validators` array to settings objects for
all API functions where this makes sense.

```js
uploadcare.openDialog(null, {
  validators: [
    imagesOnly,
    maxSize(1024 * 1024),
    minDimensions(800, 600)
  ]
});
```

The list of functions includes but is not limited to `openDialog`,
`openPanel`, `fileFrom`, `filesFrom`, `dragdrop.uploadDrop`,
`dragdrop.receiveDrop`.

You should use validators instead of checking file properties
in `widget.onChange` and `widget.onUploadComplete` callbacks,
as validators work before dialog is closed thus improving user experience.

Argument in Error’s constructor is a key in the localization file
for a message shown to the user.
The key can be one of the common errors, i.e. `size`, `image`
(see [localization file][trans:errors]), or you can add a new message via
[custom localization][file-uploader-locale-custom].

You can find useful [examples in cookbook][api-reference-js-file-validation].


## Upload Dialog and Panel
{id="dialog"}

Upload dialog is modal window on top of the page. It contains set of tabs
with different files sources or file preview. Upload panel is the same thing
but in non-modal form.

* [Open dialog](#open-dialog)
* [Open panel](#open-panel)
* [Dialog API](#dialog-api)

---
<a id="open-dialog" />

**Open** a standalone **upload dialog** over page.

```js
var dialog = uploadcare.openDialog(files, [tab,] settings);
```

`files` — a file, array of files or group of files
which will be shown as already uploaded.

`tab` — name of tab opened by default (if no files uploaded).

`settings` — [settings object][file-uploader-config-object].


---
<a id="open-panel" />

**Open a panel** in specified place.

```js
var panel = uploadcare.openPanel(placeholder, files, [tab,] settings);
```

`placeholder` — selector or DOM element which will be
replaced with panel and will be placed back after panel resolving.

`settings` — [settings object][file-uploader-config-object].


### Dialog API
{id="dialog-api"}

Both panel and dialog instances implement extended jQuery
[promise interface][ext-jquery-promise-interface]
with progress on user switch tab.

```js
dialog.done(function(result) {
  // Dialog closed and file or file group chosen.
});

dialog.fail(function(result) {
  // Dialog closed and no file or file group was selected.
  // The result argument is either null, or the last selected file.
});

dialog.always(function() {
  // Handle dialog closing, regardless of file selection.
});

dialog.progress(function(tabName) {
  // tabName is selected
});
```

In addtition to jQuery
[promise interface][ext-jquery-promise-interface],
dialog and panel objects have following properties and methods:

+-------------------+------------+---------------------------------------------------+
|     Property      |    Type    |                       Value                       |

## Custom Tabs
{id="custom-tabs"}

Besides buit-in tabs (`file`, `url`, `dropbox`, etc.) you can implement
and add tab with custom behavior to dialog. This is relatively complex,
but powerful way to customize dialog.


---
<a id="custom-tabs-register" href="#custom-tabs-register" />

**Register new tab** with given name.

```js
uploadcare.registerTab(name, constructor);
```

`name` — name which can be used in
[tabs][file-uploader-upload-sources] list.

`constructor` — function which will be called to create new tab.


---
<a id="custom-tabs-constructor" href="#custom-tabs-constructor" />
Constructor is called each time when new dialog is opened.
It should have the following declaration:

```js
function myTab(container, button, dialogApi, settings, name) {
  ...
}
```

`container` — jQuery object with main tab element.

`button` — jQuery object with tab button.

`dialogApi` — [object](#dialog-api) with useful methods to control dialog.

`settings` — [settings object][file-uploader-config-object].

`name` — name used for registering tab and in
[tabs][file-uploader-upload-sources] list.
One constructor can be registered under several names.

## Drag and drop
{id="drag-and-drop"}


---

This boolean parameter is set to `true` if browser
supports drag and drop and file API.

```js
var browser_supports_dragdrop = uploadcare.dragdrop.support;
```


---
<a id="upload-drop" />

Get file objects after dropping them on `el` element.
`el` can be DOM element, selector or jQuery object.

```js
uploadcare.dragdrop.uploadDrop(el, callback[, settings]);
```

For instance, one file will be uploaded
(if you put more than one file, it will be the first of them)

```js
uploadcare.dragdrop.uploadDrop(el, function(file) {
  file.done(...);
});
```

or all files will be uploaded

```js
uploadcare.dragdrop.uploadDrop(el, function(files) {
  files; // array
}, {multiple: true});
```

`settings` is [settings object][file-uploader-config-object].


---
<a id="receive-drop" />

Get raw data after dropping files on `el` element.
`el` can be DOM element, selector or jQuery object.

```js
uploadcare.dragdrop.receiveDrop(el, callback);
```

For example:

```js
uploadcare.dragdrop.receiveDrop(el, function(type, data) {
  type; // 'object' or 'url'
  data; // Array of native File objecs or URLs.

  // File retrieving (or the first file retrieving if there are some)
  var file = uploadcare.fileFrom(type, data[0]);

  // Retrieving of all files
  var fileArray = uploadcare.filesFrom(type, data);
});
```


## Source tabs styling
{id="sources-style"}

File Uploader and dialog appear on your pages and you can easily override their
style [via CSS][file-uploader-styling].
But some tabs (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) are open in iframe
from our domain. You can use these methods to add custom styles to such tabs.


---

**Add plain css** code to tabs. Use classes to select specific tab.

```js
var style = ".source-facebook .main-content {background: #98AFD5;}";
uploadcare.tabsCss.addStyle(style);
```


---

**Add css file** to tabs. File url should be absolute.

```js{noAutoLinker}
uploadcare.tabsCss.addUrl("https://site.com/styles/uc.tabs.css");
```

Please note due to the fact that tabs are open via https,
there is no way to add css file via http. If your site does not support https
you can use third-party hosting with https support for such files.
Amazon S3 is a good option.
