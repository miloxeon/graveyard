# Object Recognition

Object Recognition allows categorizing and tagging images. The feature is
currently in beta and runs on the REST API v0.6. Consider implementing Object
Recognition for testing purposes only. We‚Äôll notify you about the feature status
updates via Uploadcare [changelog][changelog].

When using Uploadcare Object Recognition, you get a list of objects detected in
your image paired with confidence levels for every object class.

  "Moat": 0.63008,

}
```

## Enabling Object Recognition
{id="enable"}

The feature works on a per-project basis and is currently in beta. Consider
making a separate project via your [dashboard][dashboard] and drop us a line
with your feature request and the project‚Äôs [Public API Key][settings-keys] at
[sales@uploadcare.com][mail-sales].

## How It Works
{id="how-it-works"}

Once we enable Object Recognition for one of your projects, we analyze every
image that goes there. Hence, you should upload at least one image to a
recognition-enabled project to proceed.

You can either upload an image right in your [dashboard][dashboard] by
navigating to the ‚ÄúFiles‚Äù section of your project or use
[Upload API][api-reference-upload].

Once an image is uploaded to a recognition-enabled project, you can make an
API call to acquire a list of detected objects and related confidence levels.

## Getting Image Info
{id="get-info"}

Here‚Äôs where the technical details begin ‚öôÔ∏è Feel free to reference this section
of the document by using this
[link][intelligence-object-recognition-get-info].

Object Recognition is performed automatically for every image that is uploaded
to a recognition-enabled project. While this happens on upload, it can take
some extra time after a file `is_ready`. We currently use AWS Rekognition for
the analyses and plan adding options like Google Vision in the future.

Acquiring info on detected objects is performed via the Uploadcare
[REST API][api-reference-rest]. Object Recognition will only work with the API
`v0.6`, which is currently unreleased and requires explicit declaration.

To do so, you make [file info][api-reference-get-file-example] requests to our
API endpoint specifying the `add_fields` parameter.

The endpoint for requesting Object Recognition info is:

```html
https://api.uploadcare.com/files/
```

There are two methods for getting info on detected objects via GET requests,
for multi-file and single-file cases:

```html
GET /files/?add_fields=rekognition_info

or

GET /files/:uuid/?add_fields=rekognition_info
```

Where:

* `add_field` parameter points our API to include `rekognition_info`, a list
  holding object classes and confidence levels, in the response JSON.
* `:uuid` identifies the unique image for which you are requesting info on
  detected objects.

<!-- Roma: Looks like something from api-refs. -->
### Request Example
{id="get-info-request"}

Single-file example:

```bash{noAutoLinker}
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.uploadcare-v0.6+json" \
     -H "Authorization: Uploadcare.Simple publickey:secretkey" \
     "https://api.uploadcare.com/files/:uuid/?add_fields=rekognition_info"
```

Multi-file example:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.uploadcare-v0.6+json" \
     -H "Authorization: Uploadcare.Simple publickey:secretkey" \
     "https://api.uploadcare.com/files/?add_fields=rekognition_info"
```

Where:

* Note, `Accept` header points at the REST API v0.6. That should be set
  explicitly because the default current API version is v0.5; it does not
  support the `add_fields` parameter.
* `Uploadcare.Simple` stands for the [auth-scheme][api-reference-rest-auth] that
  requires your Uploadcare project Public and Secret
  [keys][settings-keys].
* In a single-file example, `:uuid` identifies the image we get info for.
* In a multi-file example, no `:uuid` is provided; you will receive detection
  info for all files in your project üß¢

### Response Example
{id="get-info-response"}

Let‚Äôs request Object Recognition info for the cover image of this section. Here
is how it looked like:

<a href="https://ucarecdn.com/af9b7f02-6cbe-45bd-9bb6-9c928bf8a72e/-/preview/house-pond.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/af9b7f02-6cbe-45bd-9bb6-9c928bf8a72e/-/preview/680x680/house-pond.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/af9b7f02-6cbe-45bd-9bb6-9c928bf8a72e/-/preview/1360x1360/-/quality/lightest/house-pond.jpg 2x"
    alt="Image with water, trees and houses" />
</a><br/>

Once we make a single-file request that is properly authenticated, that‚Äôs a
response JSON we get:

```json
{
  "datetime_removed": null,
  "datetime_stored": "2018-08-07T05:31:47.326146Z",
  "datetime_uploaded": "2018-08-07T05:31:47.132454Z",
  "image_info": {
    "orientation": null,
    "sequence": false,
    "format": "JPEG",
    "height": 2432,
    "width": 3648,
    "geo_location": null,
    "datetime_original": null,
    "dpi": [
        72,
        72
    ]
  },
  "is_image": true,
  "is_ready": true,
  "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
  "original_file_url": "https://ucarecdn.com/af9b7f02-6cbe-45bd-9bb6-9c928bf8a72e/house-pond.jpg",
  "original_filename": "eberhard-grossgasteiger-767950-unsplash.jpg",
  "size": 2363253,
  "url": "https://api.uploadcare.com/files/af9b7f02-6cbe-45bd-9bb6-9c928bf8a72e/",
  "uuid": "af9b7f02-6cbe-45bd-9bb6-9c928bf8a72e",
  "variations": null,
  "video_info": null,
  "rekognition_info": {
    "Building": 0.63291,
    "House": 0.63291,
    "Housing": 0.63291,
    "Architecture": 0.63008,
    "Outdoors": 0.55667,
    "Cottage": 0.63291,
    "Pond": 0.55667,
    "Castle": 0.63008,
    "Moat": 0.63008,
    "Fort": 0.63008
  }
}
```

As you can see in the response, highest confidence levels can be found in
`rekognition_info` for `Building`, `House`, and `Housing` classes.

The possible values for `rekognition_info` are:

* `null`, the analysis has not yet finished.
* `{}`, Object Recognition was unable to identify any known objects in an image.
* `{object0: confidence0, object1: confidence1, ...}`, info on detected objects
  and related confidence levels.

The common use case with confidence levels would be setting a threshold based
on which your system will then operate.

## Recognition Results
{id="detection-examples"}

Here are some examples analyzed via our Object Recognition. Resulting data look
like lists wrapped in JSON.

You can find detected object classes like `Town`, `Carrot`, `Balcony`, and more.

The provided confidence levels are floating point numbers in the range
from 0 to 1. Check out the levels for `Urban` and `Building` classes for the
image below. Uploadcare points those are the prevailing things in it. If you
prefer percents, just multiply those numbers by 100. It can then be interpreted
as Uploadcare is 92% sure `Building` is in the following image:

<a href="https://ucarecdn.com/1b4910d6-2f93-40ad-b286-a856c27ca52e/-/preview/skyscrapers.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/1b4910d6-2f93-40ad-b286-a856c27ca52e/-/preview/680x680/skyscrapers.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/1b4910d6-2f93-40ad-b286-a856c27ca52e/-/preview/1360x1360/-/quality/lightest/skyscrapers.jpg 2x"
    alt="City landscape" />
</a><br/>

```JSON
"rekognition_info": {
  "Town": 0.91803,
  "City": 0.91803,
  "Nature": 0.56342,
  "High Rise": 0.81656,
  "Downtown": 0.86856,
  "Architecture": 0.79969,
  "Urban": 0.91803,
  "Building": 0.91803,
  "Landscape": 0.56342,
  "Skyscraper": 0.79969
}
```

The second example shows how you can get some additional context from an image.
We are 94% sure there are carrots in the image and with the same level of
confidence those carrots are `Vegetable` and `Food`, good to know üòå

Those additional context layers are not just useful for categorizing content,
but building some smart decision-making workflows for your system ü§ì

<a href="https://ucarecdn.com/45fd2e86-b208-4bf7-a175-928180453d3a/-/preview/carrots.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/45fd2e86-b208-4bf7-a175-928180453d3a/-/preview/680x680/carrots.jpg"
    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/45fd2e86-b208-4bf7-a175-928180453d3a/-/preview/1360x1360/-/quality/lightest/carrots.jpg 2x"
    alt="Carrots and salad" />
</a><br/>

```JSON
"rekognition_info": {
  "Plant": 0.93765,
  "Flora": 0.93765,
  "Food": 0.93765,
  "Tree": 0.51218,
  "Produce": 0.93765,
  "Carrot": 0.93765,
  "Conifer": 0.51218,
  "Vegetable": 0.93765,
  "Ivy": 0.60237,
  "Vegetation": 0.50727
}
```

The third example uncovers that you can go beyond objects like `Balcony` to
recognizing patterns. Say, we know there are `Ornament`, `Arabesque Pattern`,
and `Brick` in the image below üñºÔ∏è

    srcSet="https://ucarecdn.com/3e9e446b-d0e4-4626-9d7d-8538c4b7e145/-/preview/1360x1360/-/quality/lightest/street-slope.jpg 2x"
    alt="Street photo with a building with windows, balconies, and doors" />
</a><br/>

```JSON
"rekognition_info": {
  "Art": 0.60401,
  "Home Decor": 0.719,
  "Ornament": 0.60401,
  "Shutter": 0.719,
  "Arabesque Pattern": 0.60401,
  "Window": 0.719,
  "Curtain": 0.719,
  "Brick": 0.75331,
  "Window Shade": 0.719,
  "Balcony": 0.70572
}
```
