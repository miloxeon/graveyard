# Guides

This section contains Uploadcare platform guides. They were made to help you
sort out any essential file-related tasks: uploading, storage, delivery, or even
in-browser image editing. Also, here is the easiest way to integrate File
Uploader and Upload API with your app: streamline your development process by
breaking it down in simple steps you complete in minutes.

## Techniques
{id="techniques"}

### Implementing Responsive Images
{id="responsive_images"}

When developing a website, implementing responsive designs means handling
responsive images, the ones that can adapt to user devices and browsers.
Uploadcare [Image Transformations][transformations-image] help you prepare a
virtually infinite number of image versions to use with Responsive Images.

### Watermarks, Build Cover for Your Images
{id="watermarks"}

Quite often we see that some image on the web is protected with watermarks
(i.e., logos or symbols applied over it). One way to watermark an image is
to use an image processing software in manual or automatic mode. Another way is
a near-real-time on-demand image processing — a concept we cultivate within our
CDN.

### Serverless Video and Audio

Uploadcare optimizes your content delivery. The main thing here is
[delivering][delivery-cdn] your media assets via our CDN. Another thing is
optimizing your content. We support video transcoding, GIF to video conversions,
and image processing; audio transcoding is on our roadmap.

### Image Crop for Web and Mobile

Cropping images is a common task and an everyday routine for producing content.
We believe image crop should happen right in your browser and be intuitive and
simple. This tutorial is about enabling your users to crop images in any browser
with Uploadcare, no matter the device or browser they use.

[Fotorama][fotorama] is a simple yet powerful image gallery. It supports any
browsers, provides seamless, responsive experience, and lazy loading images.
By bringing Uploadcare together, you can get your galleries serverless and
powered up with best-in-class CDN delivery.

### Access to Canvas Pixels
{id="canvas_pixels"}

It is a great idea to use images from our CDN on HTML canvas.
Unfortunately browsers restrict access to canvas if an image was downloaded
from untrusted source. By default only images from the same origin
are treated as trusted. If you’ll draw the image from other origins,
the canvas will be marked as “dirty” and no pixel read will be possible
from the canvas.

### Uploaded Files Browser
{id="files_browser"}

Often you may want to allow user to choose previously uploaded files again.
Uploadcare doesn’t store relations between users and files
and also doesn’t allow the file uploader to list all files in the project
for security reasons.

## Example apps

Uploadcare is an end-to-end file API that allows you to fully manage
file uploading, storage, transformations, and delivery. All that is included in
our Python and Django integrations. In this guide, we will create an app with
an Instagram-like grid feed and image uploading.

By bringing together the Uploadcare end-to-end file handling platform and
JavaScript, you will be able to power up any web app with ready-to-use uploading,
storage, and in-browser image editing. In this guide, we will show how to use
the File Uploader to build a simple HTML5+JS Image Hosting app.

are HIPAA-compliant and painless.

## Migrating
{id="migrating"}

### Migro
{id="migro"}

If you came to Uploadcare from a DIY solution or another platform, the first
thing to migrate is to copy files from their current place to your Uploadcare
storage, so that they’re handled and delivered with an Uploadcare CDN.

### Migrating Images from Filestack
{id="from_filestack"}

Even though our [Migro][migro-guide] utility does a good job migrating your files
from Filestack to Uploadcare, image transformations are a bit more complicated
to transfer. This article holds a mapping of Filestack image transformation
operations to the Uploadcare ones. We also provide some migration practices and
visual examples.
