# Establish HIPAA-Compliant ePHI Data Flows

HIPAA is US legislation providing data privacy and security provisions for
safeguarding medical information. Uploadcare’s File API ensures your data flows
are HIPAA-compliant and painless.

Getting the HIPAA compliance would usually involve forcing your way through
piles of checklists and invoices from consulting agencies. With Uploadcare,
HIPAA-compliant file handling becomes a matter of days and completing the three
steps described below.

Before proceeding to the implementation, let’s cover what you can manage with
Uploadcare in terms of HIPAA:

* BAA: we sign a Business Associate Agreement to ensure the proper handling of
  ePHIs (Electronic Protected Health Information).
* Data Encryption: all data are encrypted in transit with SSL.
* Access Controls: you can provide minimum necessary access by using token-free
  URLs as a default in your DAM (Digital Asset Management System).
* Request Monitoring: we log all network requests (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) along
  with system logs.
* Request Auditing: we provide the needed logs upon your request.
* Backup: all customer data are backed up, you can configure custom backup
  storage.
* Risk Mitigation: when changing our infrastructure, we perform checks to assure
  ePHIs are not exposed to risks.

Now, let’s go on to the implementation steps.

## Step 1. Get an Uploadcare Account
{id="uc-account"}

You will need an Uploadcare account, navigate here to [Sign Up][account-signup].
Regarding the plan option, here’s what applies:

* You can start with the Free plan to explore the platform and set up
  your data flows with no encryption. Note, [Secure Uploading](#signed-uploads)
  are available on our Free plan.
* All the technical requirements to set up [Authenticated URLs](#authenticated-urls)
  are in place on the “Startup” plan. However, your infrastructure will not be
  covered by BAA on this plan (not HIPAA-compliant).
* To be well-equipped right from the start, go for our “Volume Plan” or
  [contact us][mail-sales] to fine-tune the pricing on the “Custom” plan.

To get started with Uploadcare, look through our [docs][docs] or leave this to
your engineering team. There's a series of guides allowing to integrate
Uploadcare with a number of development stacks and frameworks.

## Step 2. Set Up Secure Uploading
{id="signed-uploads"}

Secure Uploading is a key feature when it comes to controlling who and when can
upload data to one of your Uploadcare projects.

To enable Secure Uploading for a project, Navigate to your
[Dashboard][dashboard], create a project or pick an existing one, go to
“Secure Uploading in the project settings, and hit “Enable.”

Once enabled, each upload request will have to be signed to be accepted by our
system. Signatures are generated on your backend. The technical details are
well-covered in the Secure Uploading section of our
[docs][api-reference-signed-uploads].

Note, Uploadcare projects are separate environments that hold files and
settings. You can configure Uploadcare to power up areas of your web app that
don’t require extra security.

## Step 3. Set Up Authenticated URLs
{id="authenticated-urls"}

[Authenticated URLs][secure-delivery-authenticated-urls] is a second go-to
Uploadcare feature when handling ePHIs. Once enabled, every client will require
a token together with a URL to gain access to a file in one of your Uploadcare
projects.

Setting up Authenticated URLs requires a custom CNAME. Find the instructions
in our [Community Area][community-custom-cname] to do it. You can also shoot
us a note [here][mail-help].

## BAA and Conclusion
{id="conclusion"}

Note, your HIPAA-compliance will come in effect upon signing a Business
Associate Agreement (BAA) with Uploadcare. You can request one [here][mail-sales].

That’s it! Your product is now capable of handling ePHIs under the HIPAA act.
