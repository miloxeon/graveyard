# Serverless Media for Netlify CMS

## Netlify CMS and Git Workflow
{id="netlify-git"}

[Netlify CMS][ext-netlify-home] is an open source <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>
for your [Git][ext-git-home] workflow. It enables you to provide content
editors with a friendly UI and intuitive user experience.

Your content gets stored in a Git repository alongside your code for easier
versioning, multi-channel publishing, and the option to handle content updates
directly in Git. You can use Netlify CMS with any static site generator like
[Jekyll][ext-jekyll-home] or [Hugo][ext-hugo-home] to create faster, more
flexible web projects.

## Git as Media Storage
{id="git-storage"}

While storing files in a Git repo can be a solid workflow, some issues exist:

* Storing too many binary files or simply huge files can lead to long waits
  needed to clone the repository.
* When handling images, only include the ones you need in the repo. Stick with
  original image versions (not their derivatives) and carefully choose which
  ones to keep and which to drop.

Using Git repository is hard to scale, especially when it gets to
receiving user-generated media. Uploadcare integration helps you detach file
infrastructure routines at scale from your Netlify workflow.

As an end-to-end file handling platform, we handle content uploads, storage,
optimization, and CDN delivery. Every file on Uploadcare immediately gets to our
smart storage and is cached by our [CDN][delivery-cdn] to be further rapidly and
reliably delivered across 220k servers in 130+ countries.

Once your files are on Uploadcare, you then operate with either their CDN URLs
or UUIDs:

```cdn
https://ucarecdn.com/c4b32a69-f817-48be-b918-7eb6718f7aca/

or

c4b32a69-f817-48be-b918-7eb6718f7aca
```

Combined with our media processing engine that is especially
useful for image content which can be [transformed][transformations-image] on the fly
by including URL directives. Hence, you can store original CDN URLs in a Git
repository, while all the derivatives will be generated whenever you need them.

## Integrating Uploadcare into Netlify CMS
{id="integrating"}

Integrating Uploadcare [File Uploader][file-uploader] into
Netlify CMS is quick and here’s how you do it:

1. Make sure you’re using Netlify CMS 2.1.0+, [upgrade][ext-netlify-upgrade-version]
   if necessary.
2. Create an Uploadcare [account][account-signup].
3. Define a target project for uploads by discovering its [API key][settings-keys].
4. Remove the `media_folder` property from your CMS configuration file.
5. Add the following to your CMS configuration file:

```ruby
media_library:
  name: uploadcare
  config:
    publicKey: demopublickey # replace with your Public API key or use for testing env only
```

That’s it; you can now add media to your content via Uploadcare File Uploader in the
admin panel of your Netlify website. There’s no need to push any files to your
repo anymore: they now go to the Uploadcare storage and get delivered from our
CDN.

## On-the-fly Image Transformations
{id="processing"}

In case you want to edit any image on Uploadcare, you don’t have to upload its
updated version. We handle [Image Transformations][feature-image-processing]
on the fly via URL directives. Just include the supported ones in your image
CDN URLs.
