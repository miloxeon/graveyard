Keep your dependencies updated and give them a bleeding-edge touch. 

Gasgasgas updates all of your dependencies to their latest versions, so you gonna be _really_ productive tonight or maybe even for the whole next week if you don't wanna loose your job.

After giving a [talk about productivity](https://github.com/uyouthe/how-to-learn) I've been really wondering if we could just `import productivity`. The opinions are that we have a thick layer between what computer can do and what mood do you have. It _was_ true until gasgasgas came out, designed especially for piercing that border.  

Your insane productivity is just `npm i -g gasgasgas` away. 


## Why?

Have you ever experience being stuck to outdated versions of your dependencies?  
Have you ever just felt not enough power of will to tackle the compatiability issues?  
Have you ever felt that giggles at meetups: _hey, look at him, he's outdated_?  

These issues are no more. Fasten your seatbelts and get ready for the hyperleap.


## How?

Step 1:
```
npm i -g gasgasgas
```

Step 2:
_(at your project directory)_
```
gasgasgas
```

Step 3:  
Get ready to be _really_ productive tonight.
