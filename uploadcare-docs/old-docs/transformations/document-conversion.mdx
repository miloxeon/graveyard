# Document Conversion

Uploadcare can convert documents from all popular formats via
[REST API][api-reference-rest].

The input document file formats:
- Microsoft: DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPS, PPSX, PPT, PPTX, VSD, VSDX, SKW, WPD,
  WPS, XLR, PUB, MPP.
- Apple: KEY, MSG, NUMBERS, PAGES.
- OpenDocument: ODT, ODS, ODP.
- Text: TXT, RTF, PDF, DJVU, EML.
- Data: CSV, XPS, PS, EPS.

The output: DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, ODT, ODS, RTF, TXT, PDF, JPG, PNG.

Note:
* When converting multi-page documents to an image format (`jpg` or `png`),
the output will be a `zip` archive with one image per page.
* Use an `enhanced.jpg` output format for PDF documents with inline fonts.

## How it works
{id="workflow"}

Document Conversion requires you to create a conversion job beforehand (unlike
with [Image Transformations][transformations-image] that are applied on the fly
at the time of a user (cold) request).

The Document Conversion workflow is as follows:
1. `POST` a conversion job. The conversion params are passed in a request together with a source file UUID. 
2. Wait until the conversion job status becomes `finished`.
3. The converted target file can now be addressed via its UUID passed in a response.

Document Conversion doesn't alter your input files: it creates converted
outputs as separate files.

## REST API workflow
{id="rest-api"}

Here you can find detailed API references for
[document conversion][api-reference-rest-document-conversion].

All API requests should be [authorized][api-reference-rest-auth].

The endpoint for your requests is:

```
https://api.uploadcare.com/convert/document/
```

The converted document becomes addressable via a CDN URL alias you provided in the request:

```cdn{noAutoLinker}
https://ucarecdn.com/:uuid/document/-/format/:target-format/
```

CDN URL aliases are interchangeable with respective processed file UUIDs.

### `POST` a conversion job
{id="convert"}

`POST /convert/document/` — **сheck out detailed [conversion API reference][api-reference-rest-document-conversion].**

The conversion params are passed together with a source file UUID. These two request parameters are mandatory:
* `paths`, an array of UUIDs of your source documents to convert together with the [specified target format](#convert-url-formatting).
* `store`, a flag indicating if Uploadcare should [store][api-reference-rest-file-store] your outputs.

When applying the same set of conversion parameters to a previously converted
document, older conversion results will be replaced with the new ones
(`variations` parameter will change).

Before:

```json{noAutoLinker}
{
  ...
  "uuid": "dd7c1d17-ff16-4ae1-8b25-6b776b4a6425",
  "variations": {
    "document/-/format/doc/": "a46a4e66-fac8-4440-b426-37b662ae96d3"
  },
  ...
}
```

After:

```json{noAutoLinker}
{
  ...
  "uuid": "dd7c1d17-ff16-4ae1-8b25-6b776b4a6425",
  "variations": {
    "document/-/format/doc/": "0efdf844-2c63-4268-a908-fc56ae3a8078"
  },
  ...
}
```

#### Input file identifier formatting
{id="convert-url-formatting"}

Your source file identifiers should be formatted as follows:

```cdn
/:uuid/document/
```

The output format should be specified after the `/-/` delimiter:

```cdn
/:uuid/document/-/format/:target-format/
```

Also, you can provide a complete CDN URL. When the conversion is done, it can
be used as an alias to your converted file UUID:

```cdn{noAutoLinker}
https://ucarecdn.com/:uuid/document/-/format/:target-format/
```

`:uuid` identifies the input file. `:uuid` should be followed by
`cdn›/document/`, otherwise, your request will return an
[error][api-reference-rest-document-conversion].

<!-- `/-/` is a mandatory delimiter that helps the API tell file identifiers from
the [processing][transformations-image] operations. -->

The following operations are available for the conversion job:
* `cdn›/format/:target-format/` defines the target conversion format.
* `cdn›/page/:number/` converts a single page of a multi-paged document to either `jpg` or `png`. This method won't work for other target formats. `:number` is a one-based number for a page to convert.

In case the `cdn›/format/` operation was not found, your input document will be
converted to PDF.

### Checking conversion job status
{id="status"}

`GET /convert/document/status/:token/` — **check out detailed [job status API reference][api-reference-rest-document-status].**

Once you get a conversion job result, you can get a conversion job status via
`token`. Just put it in your request URL as `:token`.

Alternatively, you can subscribe to the `file.uploaded` event via the
webhooks REST API endpoint. This way, you'll know when conversion routines are
complete without checking your conversion job status. Learn more about
[webhooks][api-reference-rest-webhooks].

## Examples
### Requesting to convert a single document
{id="convert-example-single"}

Make sure to use your own project keys instead of `PUBLIC_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`;
the keys should point to an Uploadcare project with the [enabled](#billing)
Document Conversion feature. The `:uuid` of the source file to convert should
belong to the project specified by `PUBLIC_KEY`.

Request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.uploadcare-v0.5+json" \
     -H "Authorization: Uploadcare.Simple PUBLIC_KEY:SECRET_KEY" \
     -d '{"paths": [":uuid/document/-/format/:target-format/"], "store": "1"}' \
     "https://api.uploadcare.com/convert/document/"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "problems": {},
  "result": [
    {
      "original_source": ":uuid/document/-/format/:target-format/",
      "token": 3724130,
      "uuid": ":uuid-converted"
    }
  ]
}
```

A JSON response object holds the following parameters:
* `problems`, problems related to your conversion job, if any.
* `result`, info related to your converted output(-s):
  * `original_source`, source file identifier including a target format,
    if present.
  * `token`, a conversion job token that can be used to get a
    [job status](#status).
  * `uuid`, a UUID of your converted document.

Technically, when the document is converted, you get two UUIDs: the first is
included in `original_source`, and the second sits in `uuid`. It happens because
there are two methods to address converted files:
* `https://ucarecdn.com/:uuid/document/-/format/:target-format/` works as a CDN URL _alias_ for a converted file,
* `:uuid-converted` — the actual file identifier is used with other [REST API routines][api-reference-rest].

### Converting multiple documents
{id="convert-example-multi"}

When posting a multi-file conversion job, you get separate results and status
tokens for each source.

Request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.uploadcare-v0.5+json" \
     -H "Authorization: Uploadcare.Simple PUBLIC_KEY:SECRET_KEY" \
     -d '{"paths": [
          ":uuid/document/",
          ":uuid/document/-/format/jpg/-/page/1/",
          ":uuid"], "store": "1"}' \
     "https://api.uploadcare.com/convert/document/"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "problems": {
    ":uuid": "Bad path \":uuid\". Use :uuid/document/",
  },
  "result": [
    {
      "original_source": ":uuid/document/-/format/jpg/-/page/1/",
      "token": 445630631,
      "uuid": ":uuid-processed"
    },
    {
      "original_source": ":uuid/document/",
      "token": 445630637,
      "uuid": ":uuid-processed"
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, there is a problem with one of the inputs in this example.
The problem is caused by the incorrect entry in `paths`: no `/document/` is
included in the third item.

### Get conversion job status
{id="status-request"}

Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.uploadcare-v0.5+json" \
     -H "Authorization: Uploadcare.Simple PUBLIC_KEY:SECRET_KEY" \
     "https://api.uploadcare.com/convert/document/status/:token/"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "processing",
  "error": null,
  "result": {
    "uuid": ":uuid-processed"
  }
}
```

A conversion job output is a JSON object holding the following parameters:
* `status`, conversion job status, can have one of the following values:
  * pending — a source file is being prepared for conversion.
  * processing — conversion is in progress.
  * finished — the conversion is finished.
  * failed — we failed to convert the source, see `error` for details.
  * canceled — the conversion was canceled.
* `error`, holds a conversion error if it was unable to handle your file.
* `result`, repeats the contents of your conversion output.
* `uuid`, a UUID of a converted target file.

Once your conversion job is `finished`, you are free to add any
[RFC3986 compliant][delivery-filename] filename when accessing your
outputs via their [CDN URL aliases](#workflow), here is an example:

```cdn{noAutoLinker}
https://ucarecdn.com/:uuid/document/-/format/pdf/report-converted.pdf
```

## Billing
{id="billing"}

The feature is available on all paid plans. We charge for document
conversions separately:

* Document Conversion is billed in units.
* The total amount of spent conversion units can be found in
  [your dashboard][dashboard].
* The single conversion unit costs 0.045 USD.
* One unit accounts for 50 MB of a file subjected to conversion.
* Conversion outputs are put to your Uploadcare project; this affects your
  _storage limits_ that you can also monitor in [your dashboard][dashboard].
* Each conversion operation takes one _upload unit_. Document conversions are
  applied externally, so we upload an output to your account once it is
  generated.
* Your _traffic limits_ are left intact.
