# React File Uploader

Receive files from your users with a clean, lightweight and easy-to-integrate
widget. This React component helps you integrate Uploadcare Widget into your
React app natively; props management and lazy loading are bundled.

[GitHub &rarr;][react-github]

See a lazy-loading [React component][react-github] example at
[codesandbox.io][ext-sandbox-react-demo].

## Features

* Upload files from a local disk, camera, and cloud source (up to 5 TB)
* Multipart uploading for large files
* Bulk file uploading
* In-browser image editing
* Uploading network to speed uploading jobs (like CDN)

## Integration

Run this command in your project's directory:

```bash
npm install @uploadcare/react-widget
```

This way, you'll get a ready-to-use _component_ to include it in the layout.

Open your `/src/App.js` and add the following line along with other imports to
load the newly installed component:

```js
import { Widget } from "@uploadcare/react-widget";
```

## Usage example

To use the File Uploader component, add this code to your `/src/App.js` or
another template of your choice:

```jsx
<p>
  <label htmlFor='file'>Your file:</label>{' '}
  <Widget publicKey='YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY' id='file' />
</p>
```

Just replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` with your [Public API Key][settings-keys-public]
in the code above.

Finally, open your app in a browser, or run it again via `npm start` and that’s
it.

## Settings and Events
{id="advanced-settings"}

The File Uploader is [highly customizable][file-uploader-options]. The component
uses the **camelCase** notation of the options names; these name versions are
called `Object key` in Options Summary.

For example, this is how you allow uploading files only from local storage and
URLs via the `tabs` attribute and enable the preview step via the `previewStep`
attribute:

```jsx
<Widget
  id='file'
  name='file'
  tabs='file url'
  previewStep='true' />
```

Regarding the events, you can use `onChange` and `onFileSelect`. These are
well described in our [API reference][api-reference-js-widget-events] and in
the README of the [component’s GitHub repo][react-github].
A couple of basic examples:

```jsx
// ...
  onFileSelect={(file) => {
    console.log('File changed: ', file)

    if (file) {
      file.progress(info => console.log('File progress: ', info.progress))
      file.done(info => console.log('File uploaded: ', info))
    }
  }}
  onChange={info => console.log('Upload completed:', info)}
// ...
```
