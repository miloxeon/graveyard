# Glossary
Here, you'll find descriptions of specific and proprietary terms that we use on
our website, and in our interfaces and APIs.

## Project
{id="project"}

The main entity within your Uploadcare account. Each project has a unique name,
dedicated storage, settings, API keys, etc. Create as many projects as you need.
You can set up shared access to a corporate project for multiple Uploadcare
accounts by contacting [support][mail-help].

## Keys
{id="keys"}

Uploadcare **Public** and **Secret API Keys** are used to identify ownership and
establish a connection between your application and your Uploadcare project.
The Public Key is used for uploading files to a certain project, and the Secret
Key is used for file management, to perform async operations, etc. Also, your
Secret Key provides [Security](#security) for uploads and delivery.

## Uploads
{id="uploads"}

The means of uploading your files into your Uploadcare storage. Developers can
utilize [File Uploader](#file-uploader) (with
[integrations][integrations-wrappers] for all popular frameworks) or
[API clients][integrations-clients] for all popular programming languages,
including [mobile platforms][integrations-mobile].

### UUID
{id="uuid"}

A Universally Unique Identifier given to each file when it's uploaded to your
Uploadcare project. UUID is a part of CDN URL, and can be used to manipulate
file via REST API.

### File Uploader
{id="file-uploader"}

A website file uploading module that you can embed into your website as a dialog
window, panel, or button. File Uploader is linked with your Uploadcare project
via the Public Key. This module works in all modern browsers.

### File Uploader API
{id="file-uploader-api"}

The Application Programming Interface in the form of a JS SDK for
[File Uploader](#file-uploader) customization. The interface, behavior, and File
Uploader features can be customized to match your website design and function.
For example, you can add custom file validation functions to File Uploader.

### Upload Sources
{id="upload-sources"}

The sources from which you and your end users can upload images and other
content. An uploading source can be a local drive, camera, social networks, or
cloud services, such as Google Photos, Facebook, Instagram, Facebook,
Dropbox, Flickr, etc.

### Custom OAuth Applications
{id="custom-oauth-applications"}

An option to use the OAuth protocol to connect to Upload Sources.
With this feature, your app will request permissions to your app when accessing
Upload Sources.

### Storage
{id="storage"}

Your primary project's storage that keeps the original file versions. When
applying [CDN operations](#cdn-operations), the original files stays intact.
Overall storage size (for all projects) is set by your plan.

### Storing
{id="storing"}

A process of saving your files to Uploadcare storage after they're uploaded.
The **Automatic file storing** option stores all incoming files as long as
they’re not explicitly deleted.

### Custom Storage
{id="custom-storage"}

Amazon S3 Bucket storage, which you can use instead of your Uploadcare storage
if your solution or company policy requires storing all files with Amazon. Some
features like Adaptive Delivery and [CDN operations](#cdn-operations) (e.g.,
image transformations) won’t be available.

## Delivery
{id="delivery"}

A set of options to deliver [stored](#storing) files to end users and your
website visitors in a fast and reliable way. There are options for manual and
automatic delivery. Also, you can deliver files that were not explicitly loaded
and stored, for example, the results of image processing or document conversion.

### CDN
{id="cdn"}

Uploadcare CDN is a global system that delivers files to end users around the
world. It uses other CDN providers for better coverage, speed, and reliability.
Whenever a website visitor accesses a file or its variant, it gets copied to
the closest CDN node and then it gets cached there.

### Bi-directional CDN
{id="bi-directional-cdn"}
<!-- Misha: did we agree up on renaming it to Upload Network? -->

Traditionally, CDN is for delivery only. Uploadcare introduces this term to show
an accelerated uploading technology that works similar to the delivery network.
When commiting a file to upload, the Uploader will select the closest server to
minimize uploading time.

### CDN Operations
{id="cdn-operations"}

Commands that are added to the CDN link that can transform images, convert
documents, encode videos, get file info, and do other operations without any
coding.

### Adaptive Delivery
{id="adaptive-delivery"}

Next-generation responsive design. Adaptive Delivery JS library helps you
optimize image content automatically depending on a client's device, web browser
and other parameters.

### Custom CNAME
{id="custom-cname"}

Use your own domain for CDN links to your files stored with Uploadcare.
By default, all file URLs use `ucarecdn.com` domain. By setting a Custom
CNAME, the file URLs can use `cdn.mycompany.com` instead.

### Proxy
{id="proxy"}

Proxy allows you manage files that are already hosted on your website and
optimize their delivery with Uploadcare while skipping the manual upload (each
file is uploaded to CDN after the first request).

### Proxy Endpoint
{id="proxy-endpoint"}

A Proxy Endpoint is a URL prefix that goes before the original link to the file
on your domain. For example `https://yoursite.ucr.io/https://yoursite.com/assets/image.jpg`.
This will deliver image.jpg file using Uploadcare CDN.

### Whitelist
{id="whitelist"}

An option that allows uploading images from the domains you trust when using
[Proxy](#proxy) and [Adaptive Delivery](#adaptive-delivery).
This can help you build a more secure and closed system for end users.
Each [Uploadcare project](#project) has its own Whitelist.

## Transformations
{id="transformations"}

A set of functions to manipulate images, [process videos](#video-processing), and
[convert documents](#document-conversion). Accessible via CDN link commands and
REST API.

### Image Transformations
{id="image-transformations"}

On-the-fly [image transformations][transformations-image] such as compress,
resize, crop, rotate, flip, change colors, blur, sharpen, set overlay, and many
other (about a hundred). The transformations are applied in real
time at the moment when the image is requested by the client. The transformed
images are cached on the CDN and load even faster the next time.

### Video Processing
{id="video-processing"}

The process of video conversion, that enables your video file to be played on
the web by the modern browsers, and gives it an optimal file size. Also, you can
apply some transformations on the Video Processing step. This feature is available
via the REST API.

### Document Conversion
{id="document-conversion"}

The process of document conversion from one format into another. For example,
you can convert DOC to PDF, or a PDF into a set of images. Document conversion
can be done through the REST API.

## Intelligence
{id="intelligence"}

A set of artificial intelligence technologies for finding faces, objects, and
colors in images for subsequent smart processing, filtering, and categorization.

### Smart Crop
{id="smart-crop"}

A content-aware feature that crops images to prominent objects, such as faces
and objects automatically. It can be used as a standalone feature, and it's also
a part of [Adaptive Delivery](#adaptive-delivery).

### Smart Compression
{id="smart-compression"}

AI used to select an applicable image format (e.g., JPEG, WebP) and compression
ratio so the file size is reduced while still keeping the visual quality. This
operation can be used explicitly as a [CDN transformation](#cdn-operations) or
implicitly with [Adaptive Delivery](#adaptive-delivery) enabled.

### Smart Blur
{id="smart-blur"}

AI that can blur faces and other objects (e.g., cats, or houses) automatically.
This way, you don't have to specify box coordinates on images that you want to
process.

<!-- ### Smart Resize
AI that works as a part of the responsive design technology and
resizes images for specific placeholders, and for smaller viewports
(e.g., on a smartphone). -->

### Auto-enhance
{id="auto-enhance"}

An automatic procedure that applies certain filters, such as contrast,
brightness, vibrance, and color to improve visual characteristics. This
technology analyzes the initial image and its properties. Based on the analysis,
it picks values for each improvement.

## Security
{id="security"}

A set of options to provide security for uploading, access and delivery of your
files to end users. Includes Secure Uploading and Secure Delivery.

### Secure Uploading
{id="secure-uploading"}

A feature to control who can upload files to an Uploadcare project within your
account. Your backend generates [a signature][api-reference-signed-uploads-make-signature]
using [a Secret Key](#keys) and includes an expiration time parameter. A client
is required to include a valid signature in an upload request. It works with
[Uploadcare File Uploader][file-uploader] and [Upload API][api-reference-upload].

### Secure Delivery
{id="secure-delivery"}

This security feature lets you control who and for how long can access files in
your project via authenticated URLs. In other words, it's a CDN URL with a
signature generated on your backend (similar to Secure Uploading). This
feature works in conjunction with [a Custom CNAME](#custom-cname).

## Uploadcare APIs
{id="uploadcare-apis"}

A set of APIs for all system components. The Upload API is used to upload files
while the REST API is used to manipulate stored files (e.g., store, copy,
delete, apply conversions).
