# Serverless File Uploads for JavaScript

<BadgesBox>
  <Badge>14 Minutes to Integrate</Badge>
</BadgesBox>

Uploadcare [File Uploader][file-uploader] is written in JavaScript, so there's
no API wrapper needed. Everything is integrated flawlessly and natively.

[Uploadcare][home] is an end-to-end file handling platform that lets you upload
files, store them in a secure cloud storage. All platform features are
accessible via API.

In this guide, you'll learn how to use integrate File Uploader to and build a
simple HTML5 image hosting app with a minumum of JS code.

## Features

* Upload files from a local disk, camera, and cloud source (up to 5 TB)
* Multipart uploading for large files
* Bulk file uploading
* In-browser image editing
* Uploading network to speed uploading jobs (like CDN)

## Before We Begin
{id="preparations"}

### Uploadcare Account
{id="preparations-uc"}

In case you don’t have an Uploadcare account, [Sign Up][account-signup] for one.
Once you get it, navigate to your [dashboard][dashboard] to create a new
[project][settings-projects] or discover [Public API Key][settings-keys] for an
existing one.

If you’re going to upload non-image content, add [billing info][account-billing]
to your account settings.

### Sample App
{id="preparations-app"}

Let’s take a look at the simple Image Hosting app we want to build: single-page
image gallery powered by our File Uploader to add media. Play around with the
demo to capture the essence of what we’re up to:

<!-- https://codepen.io/uploadcare/pen/oQGvOz -->
<CodePen id="oQGvOz" title="Simple Image Hosting – Uploadcare Demo" />

In the demo above we used [Local Storage][ext-mdn-localstorage] to save and
update the list of files on the hosting. This way we made a mock-up of
the real backend, so you can go through the guide using only your browser.

There is also pre-made code for displaying images on the page. It is built in
a common way (appending HTML), with a slight difference: we implement our
[Image Processing][feature-image-processing] to render image previews.

To set up file uploading in an app like this by hand, you would have a lot
of work to get done: coding backend methods for file uploading, processing,
and delivery, creating an upload interface on the frontend, etc.

You can either [examine the completed app code][ext-codepen-completed] or make
the app with us from scratch starting with [this code][ext-codepen-step-1].

## Step 1. Install the File Uploader
{id="installation"}

First of all, you need to include the File Uploader `<script>` element.
There are several types of its [bundles][file-uploader-install-bundles], like with
built-in jQuery or with only one locale. If you are looking to change this kind
of options, take a look at the [file uploader installation][file-uploader-install] section of
our docs.

In our case, jQuery is already there, so let’s just import the common Uploadcare
lib *after* jQuery’s `<script>`:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
<!-- ... -->
<script>UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY';</script>
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/3.x/uploadcare.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

As you may have noticed, there is one more `<script>` in the snippet above.
That’s where you define your [Public API Key][settings-keys-public]
you discovered at the [beginning](#preparations-uc) of this guide.

Now you need to add the File Uploader button, which will be used to open the
file uploader. By default all `<input>` elements with `role="uploadcare-uploader"` will
become the File Uploader buttons:

```html
<!-- ... -->
<div class="container mt-4">
  <div class="float-right mb-4 mt-2">
    <input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" id="uploadedImage" />
  </div>
  <h2 class="mb-4">Simple Image Hosting</h1>
<!-- ... -->
```

Save your changes and take a look at your working button & file uploader:

<CodePen id="PxJbBK" title="Simple Image Hosting – Before Step 2" />

## Step 2. Store Data on Your Backend
{id="backend"}

When you’re done with the installation, it’s time to store the info of
the uploaded files on your backend. In our case, the `saveImage()` method will
serve as the backend.

In the first step, we used File Uploader’s ability to catch all the
`<input role="uploadcare-uploader">`. But now we need to use the File Uploader
object in the code. Let’s initialize it using the `<input>` CSS-selector:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
const widget = uploadcare.Widget('[role=uploadcare-uploader]');

// Skipped fetchImages() and saveImage()
</script>
```

Now you can [handle events][api-reference-js-widget-events] fired by the File
Uploader. To be more precise, we want to send the CDN URL of an uploaded file
to so-called backend right after the upload completes. That’s where
`onUploadComplete` with `cdnUrl` in params will help us:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
const widget = uploadcare.Widget('[role=uploadcare-uploader]');

widget.onUploadComplete(function(info) {
  saveImage(info.cdnUrl).then(() => {
    $('#uploadedImage').parent().html('<a href="javascript:refreshPage()">Refresh it!</a>')
  })
})

// Skipped fetchImages() and saveImage()
</script>
```

As you may have noticed, we also used the `Refresh it!` link to indicate the
request was sent – it is not necessary.

Save your changes and enjoy the fully functional simple Image Hosting:

<CodePen id="mQBOow" title="Simple Image Hosting – Before Step 3" />

## Step 3. Go Into Effect
{id="effects"}

Most of the image hostings know how to crop images. We’ll implement a solution
too. [Effects Tab][feature-fxtab] powers the file uploader with image-editing
capabilities right in a browser.

Let’s put the Effects Tab `<script>` right after the file uploader one:

```html
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/3.x/uploadcare.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget-tab-effects/1.x/uploadcare.tab-effects.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

Effects Tab is, by design, the custom tab for the File Uploader.
To make it work, register the tab explicitly:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
uploadcare.registerTab('preview', uploadcareTabEffects);
// ...
</script>
```

The last thing is to alter the [file uploader options][file-uploader-options].
We will use these two:

* `data-effects` to set the effects you want.
* `data-preview-step` to show a preview step once files are selected. Otherwise,
  a file dialog will close and the `onUploadComplete` will be fired too soon.

That’s how it may look like:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" id="uploadedImage"
      data-preview-step="true"
      data-effects="crop,rotate,enhance,sharp,grayscale" />
```

And that’s it:

## Conclusion
{id="conclusion"}

You’ve just made an Image Hosting application using JavaScript and Uploadcare
without writing any frontend or backend code for file handling ✨
