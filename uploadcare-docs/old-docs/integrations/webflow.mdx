# File Uploader Integration for Webflow Forms

Webflow is a no-code website builder that lets you accomplish most aspects of
web development and website distribution via a visual editor. It has a built-in
uploader block that you can use on your pages. However, it has some limitations,
such as uploading large files, uploading from multiple sources, and editing
uploaded images.

Fortunately, you can embed an advanced File Uploader into your Webflow website.
Using it is as easy as using the default Webflow File Upload element, but with
almost no limits. With Uploadcare, you can upload files up to 5 TB and use more
input sources, including Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, etc. In this guide, we’ll
provide step-by-step instructions on how to integrate it into your Webflow
project.

## Prerequisites

Here’s what you’ll need to follow the tutorial: 

1. A paid [Webflow][webflow] account—some vital functions we will need are
   available only on paid plans.
1. An [Uploadcare account][uploadcare-signup] (with [API keys][settings-keys]).

## Step 1. Obtaining a Public API Key

An API key is a unique set of symbols identifying your Uploadcare project when
calling it from third-party services like Webflow. We’re going to use our Public
API Key to let Webflow Form know which project to push files to.

Getting a Public API Key is easy. You can copy it from:
* The top right corner of your project’s Dashboard
* The API keys tab on the left

     alt="Webflow file uploader integration"
     title="Here’s how you find API keys in your Uploadcare account." />

Now that we have all the necessary info, let’s continue to the integration
itself.

## Step 2. Add scripts with Uploadcare File Uploader
{id="add-scripts"}

When logged in, open your Webflow Dashboard, then go to the Settings (three horizontal dots).

<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/55b7a3fb-8638-4e3c-976d-e43b7acb989c/scr02.png"
     alt="Webflow file uploader integration"
     title="Open the website settings." />

In the website settings, go to the **Custom Code** tab and paste the following
script: 

```html
<script>UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY';</script>
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/3.x/uploadcare.full.min.js" data-integration="Webflow"></script>
```

Replace “YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY” with your Public API Key from Uploadcare.

     title="Paste the code to “let the page know” about the Uploadcare File Uploader Widget." />

Note: As of December 2020, Webflow only allows using Custom Code on paid plans.
See Webflow Pricing to review the available options.

If you want to change the way the file upload form will look, you can
[customize it][file-uploader-styling] and use [custom CSS][ext-webflow-custom-css]
as well.

## Step 3. Add a Webflow Form to your page
{id="add-form"}

Open your website in the Webflow Designer and add a form block to the page where
you want to add the upload button. To do this:

1. Click on **Add Elements** (+ sign).
1. Unfold the **Forms** dropdown.
1. Drag **Form block** onto the page.

     alt="Webflow file uploader integration"
     title="Webflow Elements panel." />

If you already have a form, open it in the Designer and proceed to the next
step.

Even if you want your visitor to upload a picture using a single button, we
still need to add a form in Webflow because an input field (which we’re going to
use in the next step) can only exist inside a form.

## Step 4. Bind Uploadcare File Uploader to a Webflow form input
{id="bind"}

First, we need to add a text field to the form. Again, use the **Add Elements**
button, but this time select **Input** instead of **Form Block.** Just like in
the screenshot below:

     alt="Webflow file uploader integration"
     title="Drag Input into the form." />

Once the field has been added, it should remain selected. Like in the screenshot
below, click on the gear icon in the element settings and then add
`role="uploadcare-uploader"` as a custom attribute.

     alt="Webflow file uploader integration"
     title="Click on the “+” sign in the Custom Attributes section. Use “role” as an attribute name and “uploadcare-uploader” as a value." />

Then, go to the **Style** settings (the paintbrush icon on the top right) and
hide the input field.

     alt="Webflow file uploader integration"
     title="The field will disappear but will still be available in the form section inside the Navigator tab on the left." />

## Step 5. Publish the page
{id="publish"}

To see the results, we need to publish the page. Click **Publish** and select
the options you need. In this tutorial, we will be deploying to the default
domain provided by Webflow.

     alt="Webflow file uploader integration"
     title="Depending on your plan, you may have different options here. The goal is to publish the page." />

Navigate to the page (a link icon will appear next to the domain). Let’s see the
results:

     alt="Webflow file uploader integration"
     title="A button appeared instead of the hidden field we defined." />

Clicking this button opens the widget.

     alt="Webflow file uploader integration"
     title="Here, you can select from different methods of uploading files." />

Forms are often used to upload pictures and documents. Let’s select one.

     title="The file is ready to be sent. " />
