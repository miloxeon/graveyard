# Security
<!-- @dm: Security != Privacy, тут все фичи (и гдпр с хипой), скорее, про приваси.
Можно как-то это попробовать подправить? -->

We at Uploadcare honor the safety of personal and business-sensitive information
and implement compliancy with GDPR, HIPAA and other standards and regulations.
Uploadcare provides you with advanced privacy features to upload, access and
manage your content in a secure way.

## Secure Uploading

Control who and when can upload files. It prevents from uploading files using a
Public API key only. You'll have to generate a security token
on the backend to&nbsp;upload a file. [Secure Uploading][secure-uploads] works for a particular Uploadcare project.

## Secure Delivery

Control who and when can request files. Enabling this feature limits access to
your project files. A user will require a token from your backend to access
the&nbsp;content. [Secure Delivery][secure-delivery] works in conjunction with custom domains.
[Set up a custom CNAME][community-custom-cname] to use this feature.
