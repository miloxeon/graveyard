# How to Set Up File Upload for Meteor Apps

[Meteor][ext-meteor-home] is an open-source platform for developing web and
mobile apps in JavaScript. By [integrating Uploadcare][meteor-integration],
you’ll get a responsive UI to receive image and file uploads right in your
Meteor app with no hassle about file storage or delivery.

## How Does Uploading Files, Images, and Docs to Meteor with Uploadcare Work?
{id="intro"}

Uploadcare is a complete File API that is used to build file handling on the
web. In this guide, we’ll be using the following components of the platform:

- [File Uploader][feature-file-uploader] for image and file uploading.
- [Storage][storage]. Every uploaded file goes to Uploadcare storage.
- [Uploadcare CDN][delivery-cdn]. Once uploaded, every file gets cached by our CDN layers.

We’ll show the basic Uploadcare file handling mechanics, integrate the File
Uploader in your Meteor application, and provide you with hints on where
to go from there. (It should take you only about _8 minutes_.)

Below are a couple of screen captures of a demo app. You’ll have something
similar by the end of this guide:

<Image
  uuid='b5c3f1ed-0f40-478e-8a87-dd233c048b81'
  desc='A file upload form that allows you to upload images to Meteor'
/>

<Image
  uuid='c78dbd4c-7718-42f2-a2ef-3426ffb446bc'
  desc='A JPEG image uploaded to Meteor'
/>

## Step 1. Get an Uploadcare Account
{id="get-uploadcare"}

You’ll need an account to continue and integrate the File Uploader to
your Meteor app. So, [Sign Up][account-signup] if you haven’t done so yet.

Head over to your [dashboard][account] and create a new project or go to an
existing one. Then, navigate to the “API Keys” section and find the [Public API
Key][settings-keys].

Note that if you want to go beyond the “image uploader” use case and add
non-image files to your project, you will have to provide your [billing
info][community-billing-info].

## Step 2. Install File Uploader to Meteor
{id="install-uploader"}

Run the following to install the File Uploader as our official Meteor
package:

```bash
meteor add uploadcare:uploadcare-widget
```

Specify the Public API Key you obtained in the previous step in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "public": {
    "uploadcare": {
      "publicKey": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

That’s it. Let’s get straight to the code now.

## Step 3. Add Uploader to Client HTML
{id="add-uploader"}

Once the uploader is installed, you add an `<input>` element with the specified
`uploadcare-uploader` role to `client/main.html` where you want the file
uploader to appear:

```html
<input type="hidden" id="file-show" role="uploadcare-uploader" />
```

Our Meteor library looks for such inputs and puts file uploaders there.

You can now navigate to `localhost:3000` via your browser and check out the live
uploader. Just run `meteor` in your CLI to get the server running.

When you upload a file, it goes to our storage and CDN layers.
Then, its `<input>` receives a CDN URL possessing a unique file identifier
(UUID).

Let’s take this a step further and add the cdnUrl template variable to render
that CDN URL:

```html
<template name="show">
  <h2>Show UUID after upload</h2>
  <fieldset>
    <div>
      <label for="file-show">File:</label>
      <input type="hidden" id="file-show" role="uploadcare-uploader" />
    </div>
    <p>
      {{#if uuid}}
      <a href="{{cdnUrl}}">{{uuid}}</a>
      {{else}} No UUID found, upload a file. {{/if}}
    </p>
  </fieldset>
</template>
```

## Step 4. Handling Events With JavaScript API
{id="js-api"}

Our File Uploader comes with a [JavaScript API][api-reference-javascript] to
further enhance the user experience of your web app.

Events would be a great example of something to add to your app’s design. Here’s
how you handle the `onUploadComplete` event with the JavaScript API of our
uploader (a snippet from our demo app on [GitHub][meteor-github-demo]):

```javascript
import uploadcare from 'meteor/uploadcare:uploadcare-widget'

...

let widget = uploadcare.Widget('[role=uploadcare-uploader]')

widget.onUploadComplete(info => {
    // Handle the uploaded file info.
    this.uuid.set(info.uuid)
    this.cdnUrl.set(info.cdnUrl)
})
```

Please refer to the uploader’s JavaScript [API
reference][api-reference-js-widget-events] to learn more about supported events.

## Step 5. File Uploader Options
{id="file-uploader-configure"}

The File Uploader is highly customizable. Playing with our live file uploader
[configurator][file-uploader-configure] would be a great starting point. You can
always share configurations with your team: every option gets added to the
configurator’s URL query string. Here’s an
[example][file-uploader-configure-preset]:

```
https://uploadcare.com/widget/configure/?effects=crop+enhance&imagesOnly=true&multiple=true
```

From there, you can check out the Uploadcare documentation where we cover [the
ways of setting the options][file-uploader-config] as well as the complete [file
uploader options summary][file-uploader-options].

For example, this is how you locally (for a single file uploader instance) set
the option allowing [image-only][file-uploader-option-images-only] uploads:

```html
<input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" ... data-images-only />
```

Note that changing any options when the File Uploader is running won’t affect
its behavior.

## Conclusion
{id="conclusion"}

Yay! We just covered the basics of enabling your Meteor web app with serverless
file uploads and delivering the uploaded assets via CDN. Consider checking out
our [uploader’s docs][feature-file-uploader] for further reading.
